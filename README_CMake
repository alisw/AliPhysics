Note: The CMake build of AliRoot builds out-of-source

Steps to Build AliRoot with CMake :

1. Check out Aliroot source into a folder (usually specified by the environment variable ALICE)
	
	cd $ALICE
	svn co https://alisoft.cern.ch/AliRoot/trunk AliRoot

Note: Please use https:// if you want to be able to commit changes to the SVN repository.

2. Set the environment variable ALICE_ROOT to point to the source you have checked out

       cd AliRoot
       export ALICE_ROOT=`pwd`


3. Create a new folder where the build will take place. It must be different from the source directory!
	
	cd ..
	mkdir objdir
	cd objdir

4. Optionally specify the place for installation using the environment variable ALICE_INSTALL.
It you do not specify it, "make install" will put lib, bin and include in ALICE_ROOT

5. Optionally specify the location of Geant3 using the environment variable GEANT3DIR

6. Execute the following commands to configure the build

	cmake $ALICE_ROOT


Note: Some files CMakeLists.txt will be created in the source tree, so you need write access there. This 
is a temporary situation that will change soon.
 	
	6a.Run 
		cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG  $ALICE_ROOT
 
	to compile AliRoot in Debug configuration (-g compiler flags).
	To change the configuration later on you can either edit
	cache variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE using 'ccmake' command ('None' value for default configuration), 
	or setup default configuration by running 
		cmake $ALICE_ROOT

	6b. By default -O -g options are setting up. 

7. Build and install AliRoot. Note that the parralel build is fully operational with CMake.

   	 make -j4
	 make install

If you make changes in the source tree, it is enough to do

       	 make
	 make install

to get them in use.

9. In order to build addtional targets like THydjet and SHUTTLE add the following options to the cmake command

	cmake -DTHydjet=ON -DSHUTTLE=ON <path_to_source>

10. Static libraries can be built using

	make alilibs-static

11. Individual Modules can be built using

	make <Module>-all
	make <Module>-all-static 

eg.	make STEER-all STEER-all-static

12. Individual Packages can be built using

	make <Package>
	make <Package>-static

eg.	make STEERbase STEERbase-static

13. The code can be checked for the ALICE coding conventions on a package, module or class level using the following targets. 

  make check-all
  make <Module>-check-all
  make <Package>-check
  make <Module>-<ClassName>-check  // To use this run cmake with -DCLASSCHECK="YES" option. It is turned off by default since it bloats the Makefile and slows down the internal makefile rule checking

  The resulting violations will be written to the folder <Build_Directory>/<Module>/check/viols

14. To Build PARs the following targets can be used. The resulting packages will be created in the cmake build directory

  make par-all 
  make <Package>.par
  make <Module>-par-all   //build all par packages in the module

15. To test PARs after building run

  make test-par-all
  make test-<Package>
  make test-<Module>-par-all

!IMPORTANT! - Make sure your source folder is clean. If you used the old make system to build aliroot run make clean in the source directory before you run cmake
