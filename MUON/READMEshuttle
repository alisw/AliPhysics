How to test the Shuttle preprocessor(s) for MUON.

We will get two "logical" MUON preprocessors : one for the tracker and one for the trigger.
Both will manage several subtasks (e.g. the tracker one will handle pedestals,
 gains and deadchannels, while the trigger one will handle masks and trigger lut)
"Physically", only one class will manage both the tracker and the trigger : AliMUONPreprocessor.
Depending on the subsystem and on the task to be performed (based on the run type), this class
 will instanciate the correct set of AliMUONVSubProcessor(s) which does the actual job.
Output of most processors will end up in OCDB (Offine Condition DataBase). A set of helper functions
 to peek at this OCDB are gathered in MUONCDB.C macro.
 
-------
TestMUONPreprocessor.C
-------

This is the master macro used to check the MUON part of the Shuttle.
Depending on what you want to test, you'll have to modify the input files 
(using shuttle->AddInputFile) and/or the run type (using shuttle->AddInputRunParameter())

-------
AliMUONPreprocessor(const TString& detName)
-------

Depending on how this one is constructed, and depending on the runtype, it will
 perform differents tasks. Note that for the moment the runtypes are "fake", i.e.
 put by hand in the TestMUONPreprocessor.C macro, and might not correspond to
 the final values to be used by the DAQ.

----------
Pedestals
----------

Two options here. You can either use a pre-done set of ASCII pedestals files (generated as
 explained below for the 2nd option), located at /afs/cern.ch/user/l/laphecet/public/LDC*.ped, 
 or build you own set.
 
We've written an AliMUONPedestalEventGenerator which creates fake pedestal events. The pedestal values
are taken from the Offline Condition DataBase (OCDB) (which is itself fakely filled
using the writePedestals() function located in the MUONCDB.C macro.

So first generate a valid pedestal CDB entry but using the MUONCDB.C macro.

root[] .L MUONCDB.C++
root[] const char* cdbpath="local://$ALICE_ROOT/SHUTTLE/TestShuttle/TestCDB"; // where to put the CDB
root[] Bool_t defaultValues = kFALSE; // to generate random values instead of plain zeros...
root[] Int_t startRun = 80;
root[] Int_t endRun = 80;
root[] writePedestals(cdbpath, defaultValues, startRun, endRun);

Expected output is (don't worry about the warnings, they are harmless) :

W-AliMpExMap::AddKey: AliMpExMap::AddKey: resized Key array 
W-AliMpExMap::AddKey: AliMpExMap::AddKey: resized Key array 
W-AliMpExMap::AddKey: AliMpExMap::AddKey: resized Key array 
W-AliMpExMap::AddKey: AliMpExMap::AddKey: resized Key array

W-AliMpExMap::AddKey: AliMpExMap::AddKey: resized Key array

W-AliMpExMap::AddKey: AliMpExMap::AddKey: resized Key array

W-AliMpExMap::AddKey: AliMpExMap::AddKey: resized Key array

W-AliMpExMap::AddKey: AliMpExMap::AddKey: resized Key array 
16828 Manus and 1064008 channels.
Ngenerated = 1064008

Then use the AliMUONPedestalEventGenerator to produce simulated pedestal events.

Usage :
root[] AliCDBManager::Instance()->SetDefaultStorage(cdbpath); // so you will read 
// back pedestals values generated in the previous step
root[] const char* dateFileName = "raw.date"; // base filename for the output
root[] Int_t runNumber = 80; // run number used to fetch the pedestals from the OCDB 
root[] Int_t nevents = 100; // # of events to generate. 100 should be enough
root[] AliMUONPedestalEventGenerator ped(runNumber,nevents,dateFileName);
root[] ped.Exec("");

It *will* take a lot of time (mainly due to the fact that we're writting a 
bunch of ASCII files = DDL files), so please be patient.

The output should be the normal simulated sequence of MUON.Hits.root, MUON.SDigits.root,
 MUON.Digits.root, raw/*.ddl files and raw.date.LDCi where i=0-3 (i.e. one DATE file
per LDC, as will be used in real life), the latter ones being roughly 100 MB each.

The raw.date.LDC* files are then processed using the makeped online program 
(currently found, pending an agreement on where to put online programs under cvs,
 under /afs/cern.ch/user/a/abaldiss/public/v15; Please contact Alberto to check 
 it's the latest version) which outputs manus-*.ped ASCII files (one per LDC) :
 
 makeped -f raw.date.LCDi (i=0,1,2,3)
 mv manus-1.ped LDCi.ped
 
 (repeat for each LDC)

The LDCi.ped files are the input for the pedestal subprocessor,
which is tested using the TestMUONPreprocessor.C macro. 
The output of the pedestal subprocessor (upon success only) is written into the OCDB. 
Difference between the input and the output can be inferred using the diff() function
of MUONCDB.C macro.


-------
HV
-------

HV DCS values are created in CreateDCSAliasMap() of TestMUONPreprocessor.C
You might want to modify this function to create a given set of error conditions
 in order to test whether the HVSubprocessor is reacting properly to those errors.
