   BASIC INSTALLATION

1) Once you have unpacked your tarball into a new (sub)directory,
   the first step is to run the "configure" script. If you accept the 
   default compiler options, and plan to run PYTHIA 8 standalone, you 
   only have to type "./configure". This will create the file config.mk. 
   Actually, running this script by hand is optional since "make" will 
   run "configure" anyway, but possible errors in the paths will be 
   less clearly visible.

2) Type "gmake" or "make". This will create an archive library. 
   On Linux systems gmake and make are usually equivalent. For others, 
   in case of doubt, use gmake. This applies below as well.

3) The library should now be ready for use. To study some examples,
   go to the "examples" subdirectory. The README file in that 
   subdirectory contain further instructions how executables can 
   be built and run.
    
4) At any time, typing "gmake clean" will remove all files related to
   the library compilation, including the library itself, but it will
   not reset the configure selections. With "gmake distclean" additionally
   the configure selection is reset, and many other temporary files are
   removed. Output files you may have created during your test runs are
   not affected. (A "gmake clean" is also available in the examples 
   subdirectory, see the README there.)

   ADVANCED INSTALLATION

1) If you want to set various compilation options, or prepare the 
   linking to the HepMC external library then the "configure" script 
   will have to do more work. There are two different ways to 
   accomplish this.

1.1)  You can use command-line arguments to set up the desired library 
     links. The possible options are:
     --help : prints a brief summary of the options described here.
     --enable-debug : turns on debugging flags and turns off optimization.
         (This makes program execution much slower. If you later want to 
         switch optimization back on you have to rerun configure without
         this option, since default is to allow optimization.)
     --enable-shared : turns on shared-library creation,
         in addition to the archive libraries always built.
     --enable-64bits : turns on 64 bits compilation flag
         (is automatic on many 64-bit installations, but just in case).
     --lcgplatform=name : allows you to specify the platform assumed for
         compilation, which also affects the assumed location of the 
         libraries below; default is x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt while other 
         supported values for name include slc4_ia32_gcc34, 
         slc4_amd64_gcc34 and slc3_ia32_gcc323 (deprecated). 
     --installdir=name : absolute path to a directory where the compiled
         library and header file directories will be copied, by a 
         "gmake install" command subsequent to the "gmake" one. 
         Note that the files in the current working directory are kept. 
     --prefix=name : equivalent alternative to --installdir=name.
     --datadir=name : absolute path to a directory where the xmldoc
         data directory will be copied, by a "gmake install" command 
         subsequent to the "gmake" one. Defaults to the same as 
         --installdir=name if not set separately.
     --with-hepmc=path : the path to your local copy of the HepMC library.
         You must use version 2.06 (or later). If the path does not 
         contain the version number you will be warned about it.    
     --with-hepmcversion=v : a simpler alternative to the above, valid 
         if you are using the CERN AFS LCG external area.
     --enable-gzip     : enable support for gzipped LHE file reading
     --with-boost=path   see GZIP SUPPORT section below for
     --with-zlib=path    further details
     There also are a few environment variables that you can set to 
     force the configuration process or add flags:
     USRCXXFLAGS : to add flags. Use this variable to add -fPIC to the 
         compilation flags for the static libraries
     USRLDFLAGSSHARED : to add flags to the shared library build command
     USRSHAREDSUFFIX : to force shared libraries suffix to be like this 
         (default on MacOSX is dylib).

1.2) If you want to use the external HepMC from some different location, 
     or it is more convenient to put the paths directly into the script,
     then you have to edit the "configure" file by hand before you run 
     it. Search in the "configure" file for
       HEPMCLOCATION
     and provide the paths where you have the respective libraries
     installed on your local platform.

   Information on the selected paths is stored in the files config.mk,
   examples/config.sh and examples/config.csh when you run "./configure".

1.3) The CC and FC global environment variables can be set to specify 
   the C++ and Fortran 77/90 compilers, otherwise set in 
   <code>configure</code> and <code>examples/configure</code>.

2) If you want to change the version of HepMC, you have to
   rerun the script "configure" with relevant options, then type "make" 
   to recompile the library hepmcinterface. If you tried already to run 
   examples with previous versions, pay attention to the environment 
   variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (see README in examples).

   Hints on how to install HepMC from scratch can be found in the
   separate README.HepMC file.

3) If you have two CPUs or cores on your computer then using the -j2 
   option on make/gmake may speed up compilation.

4) Necessary data are automatically loaded when you use the default 
   PYTHIA installation directory structure and run the main programs in 
   the examples subdirectory. However, in the general case, you must 
   provide the path to the .xml files, originally stored in the xmldoc 
   directory, where default settings and particle data are found. This 
   can be done in two ways.

4.1) You can set the environment variable PYTHIA8DATA to contain the 
     location of the xmldoc directory. In the csh and tcsh shells this 
     could e.g. be
       setenv PYTHIA8DATA /home/myname/pythia81xx/xmldoc
     while in other shells it could be
       export PYTHIA8DATA=/home/myname/pythia81xx/xmldoc
     where xx is the subversion number.
     Recall that environment variables set locally are only defined in 
     the current instance of the shell. The above lines should go into 
     your .cshrc and .bashrc files, respectively, if you want a more 
     permanent assignment.

4.2) You can provide the path as argument to the Pythia constructor in 
     your main program, e.g.
       Pythia pythia("/home/myname/pythia81xx/xmldoc");
     where again xx is the subversion number.

   When PYTHIA8DATA is set it takes precedence, else the path in the 
   constructor is used, else one defaults to the ../xmldoc directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

   GZIP SUPPORT (experimental)

The '--enable-gzip' options turns on support for the reading of
gzipped LHE files. It relies upon Boost and zlib to function, and
the locations of these must be set with the '--with-boost=boost_path'
and '--with-zlib=zlib_path' options. Specifically, it requires (note
that .so should be replaced with .dylib for Mac OS X):
  boost_path/include/boost/iostreams/ (with the appropriate files
                                       in this directory)
  boost_path/lib/libboost_iostreams.so (or boost_path/lib64/...)
  zlib_path/libz.so

Note that when compiling a final PYTHIA executable, these libraries
must also be included, e.g.:
  -Lboost_path/lib -lboost_iostreams -Lzlib_path -lz
This is done automatically for the examples in the 'examples' and
'rootexamples' directories when gzip support is enabled.

When running the executable, if the Boost and zlib libraries are
in a non-standard directory, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
for Mac OS X) must be set to include these directories, e.g. in a 
bash-type shell:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:boost_path/lib:zlib_path

Gzip support currently switches off the '-Wshadow' compiler option
to avoid the possibility of a large number of warning messages.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

   FOR WINDOWS USERS

The Makefile.msc file is intended for use on Win32/NMAKE systems with 
the  Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler. This alternative installation
is not the development platform, however, and therefore not as well 
tested. Not all parts of the above installation procedure are the same,
so some experimentation may be required. A few suggestions are found 
in the the separate README.Win32 file.
