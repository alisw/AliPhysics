<h1>PYTHIA 8</h1>

<h2>Welcome to PYTHIA - The Lund Monte Carlo!</h2>

<p/>
PYTHIA 8 is the successor to PYTHIA 6, rewritten from scratch in C++. 
With the release of PYTHIA 8.1 it now becomes the official "current" 
PYTHIA version, although PYTHIA 6.4 will be supported in  parallel 
with it for some time to come. Specifically, the new version has not 
yet been enough tested and tuned for it to have reached the same level 
of reliability as the older one. This testing will only happen if 
people begin to work with the program, however, which is why we 
encourage a gradual transition to the new version, starting now. 
There are some new physics features in PYTHIA 8.1, that would make 
use of it more attractive, but also some topics still missing, where 
6.4 would have to be used. Further, many obsolete features will not 
be carried over, so for some backwards compatibility studies again 
6.4 would be the choice.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

On these webpages you will find the up-to-date manual for PYTHIA 8.1.
Use the left-hand index to navigate this documentation of program 
elements, especially of all possible program settings. All parameters 
are provided with sensible default values, however, so you need only 
change those of relevance to your particular study, such as choice of 
beams, processes and phase space cuts. The pages also contain a fairly 
extensive survey of all methods available to the user, e.g. to study 
the produced events. What is lacking on these webpages is an overview, 
on the one hand, and an in-depth physics description, on the other.

<p/>
The overview can be found in the attached PDF file
<br/><a href="pythia8100.pdf" target="page"><b>A Brief Introduction
to PYTHIA 8.1</b></a>
<br/>T. Sj&ouml;strand, S. Mrenna and P. Skands, 
Comput. Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852 [arXiv:0710.3820].
<br/>You are strongly recommended to read this summary when you 
start out to learn how to use PYTHIA 8.1. Note that some details
have changed since the 8.100 version described there.

<p/>
For the physics description we refer to the complete 
<br/><b>PYTHIA 6.4 Physics and Manual</b>
<br/>T. Sj&ouml;strand, S. Mrenna and P. Skands, JHEP05 (2006) 026,
<br/>which in detail describes the physics (largely) implemented also in 
PYTHIA 8, and also provides a more extensive bibliography than found
here.

<p/>
When you use PYTHIA 8.1, you should therefore cite both, e.g. like
<br/><b>T. Sj&ouml;strand, S. Mrenna and P. Skands, JHEP05 (2006) 026,
Comput. Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852</b>.

<p/>
Furthermore, a separate 
<br/><a href="worksheet.pdf" target="page">
<b>PYTHIA 8 Worksheet</b></a>,
<br/>also an attached PDF file, offers a practical introduction to
using the generator. It has been developed for and used at a few 
summer schools, with minor variations, but is also suited for 
self-study.
