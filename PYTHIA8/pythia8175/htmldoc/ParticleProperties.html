<h2>Particle Properties</h2>

A <code>Particle</code> corresponds to one entry/slot in the 
event record. Its properties therefore is a mix of ones belonging 
to a particle-as-such, like its identity code or four-momentum, 
and ones related to the event-as-a-whole, like which mother it has. 

<p/>
What is stored for each particle is 
<ul>
<li>the identity code,</li> 
<li>the status code,</li> 
<li>two mother indices,</li>
<li>two daughter indices,</li> 
<li>a colour and an anticolour index,</li> 
<li>the four-momentum and mass,</li>
<li>the scale at which the particle was produced (optional),</li> 
<li>the polarization/spin/helicity of the particle (optional),</li>
<li>the production vertex and proper lifetime (optional),</li>
<li>a pointer to the particle kind in the particle data table, and</li>
<li>a pointer to the whole particle data table.</li>
</ul>
From these, a number of further quantities may be derived.

<h3>Basic output methods</h3>

The following member functions can be used to extract the most important 
information:

<a name="method1"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::id() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the identity of a particle, according to the PDG particle codes 
[<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">Yao06</a>].
  

<a name="method2"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::status() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
status code. The status code includes information on how a particle was 
produced, i.e. where in the program execution it was inserted into the 
event record, and why. It also tells whether the particle is still present 
or not. It does not tell how a particle disappeared, whether by a decay, 
a shower branching, a hadronization process, or whatever, but this is 
implicit in the status code of its daughter(s). The basic scheme is:
<ul>
<li>status = +- (10 * i + j)</li>
<li> +          : still remaining particles</li>
<li> -          : decayed/branched/fragmented/... and not remaining</li>
<li> i =  1 - 9 : stage of event generation inside PYTHIA</li>
<li> i = 10 -19 : reserved for future expansion</li>
<li> i >= 20    : free for add-on programs</li>
<li> j = 1 - 9  : further specification</li>
</ul>

  <li>45 : incoming rescattered parton, with changed kinematics
           owing to ISR in the mother system (cf. status 34)</li>
  <li>46 : incoming copy of recoiler when this is a rescattered 
           parton (cf. status 42)</li>
  </ul>
<li>51 - 59 : particles produced by final-state-showers</li>
  <ul>
  <li>51 : outgoing produced by parton branching</li>
  <li>52 : outgoing copy of recoiler, with changed momentum</li>  
  <li>53 : copy of recoiler when this is incoming parton, 
           with changed momentum</li>  
  <li>54 : copy of a recoiler, when in the initial state of a 
           different system from the radiator</li>
  <li>55 : copy of a recoiler, when in the final state of a 
           different system from the radiator</li>
  </ul>
<li>61 - 69 : particles produced by beam-remnant treatment</li>
  <ul>
  <li>61 : incoming subprocess particle with primordial <i>kT</i> 
           included</li>
  <li>62 : outgoing subprocess particle with primordial <i>kT</i> 
           included</li>
  <li>63 : outgoing beam remnant</li>  
  </ul>
<li>71 - 79 : partons in preparation of hadronization process</li>
  <ul>
  <li>71 : copied partons to collect into contiguous colour singlet</li>

           to a diquark</li>  
  <li>75 : gluons split to decouple a junction-antijunction pair</li> 
  <li>76 : partons with momentum shuffled to decouple a 
           junction-antijunction pair </li>
  <li>77 : temporary opposing parton when fragmenting first two 
           strings in to junction (should disappear again)</li>
  <li>78 : temporary combined diquark end when fragmenting last 
           string in to junction (should disappear again)</li>
  </ul>
<li>81 - 89 : primary hadrons produced by hadronization process</li>
  <ul>
  <li>81 : from ministring into one hadron</li>
  <li>82 : from ministring into two hadrons</li>
  <li>83, 84 : from normal string (the difference between the two 
           is technical, whether fragmented off from the top of the 
           string system or from the bottom, useful for debug only)</li>
  <li>85, 86 : primary produced hadrons in junction fragmentation of 
           the first two string legs in to the junction, 
           in order of treatment</li>
  </ul>
<li>91 - 99 : particles produced in decay process, or by Bose-Einstein 
  effects</li>
  <ul>

           or with oscillation</li>
  <li>99 : particles with momenta shifted by Bose-Einstein effects
           (not a proper decay, but bookkept as an <i>1 -> 1</i> such,
           happening after decays of short-lived resonances but before
           decays of longer-lived particles)</li>
  </ul>
<li>101 - 109 : particles in the handling of R-hadron production and 
  decay, i.e. long-lived (or stable) particles containing a very heavy
  flavour</li>
  <ul>
  <li>101 : when a string system contains two such long-lived particles,
            the system is split up by the production of a new q-qbar
            pair (bookkept as decay chains that seemingly need not conserve
            flavour etc., but do when considered together)</li>
  <li>102 : partons rearranged from the long-lived particle end to prepare
            for fragmentation from this end</li>
  <li>103 : intermediate "half-R-hadron" formed when a colour octet particle
            (like the gluino) has been fragmented on one side, but not yet on
            the other</li>
  <li>104 : an R-hadron</li>
  <li>105 : partons or particles formed together with the R-hadron during
            the fragmentation treatment</li>
  <li>106 : subdivision of an R-hadron into its flavour content, with
           momentum split accordingly, in preparation of the decay of 
           the heavy new particle, if it is unstable</li>
  <li>107 : two temporary leftover gluons joined into one in the formation
          of a gluino-gluon R-hadron.</li>
  </ul>
<li>111 - 199 : reserved for future expansion</li>
<li>201 - : free to be used by anybody</li>   
</ul>
  

<a name="method3"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::mother1() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>int Particle::mother2() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the indices in the event record where the first and last mothers are 
stored, if any. There are five allowed combinations of <code>mother1</code> 
and <code>mother2</code>:
<ol>
<li><code>mother1 = mother2 = 0</code>: for lines 0 - 2, where line 0 
represents the event as a whole, and 1 and 2 the two incoming 
beam particles; </li>
<li><code>mother1 = mother2 > 0</code>: the particle is a "carbon copy" 
of its mother, but with changed momentum as a "recoil"  effect, 
e.g. in a shower;</li>
<li><code>mother1 > 0, mother2 = 0</code>: the "normal" mother case, where 
it is meaningful to speak of one single mother to several products, 
in a shower or decay;</li>
<li><code>mother1 &lt; mother2</code>, both > 0, for 
<code>abs(status) = 81 - 86</code>: primary hadrons produced from the 
fragmentation of a string spanning the range from <code>mother1</code> 
to <code>mother2</code>, so that all partons in this range should be 
considered mothers; and analogously for 
<code>abs(status) = 101 - 106</code>, the formation of R-hadrons;</li>
<li><code>mother1 &lt; mother2</code>, both > 0, except case 4: particles 
with two truly different mothers, in particular the particles emerging 
from a hard <i>2 -> n</i> interaction.</li>
</ol>    
<br/><b>Note 1:</b> in backwards evolution of initial-state showers, 
the mother may well appear below the daughter in the event record. 
<br/><b>Note 2:</b> the <code>motherList(i)</code> method of the 
<code>Event</code> class returns a vector of all the mothers, 
providing a uniform representation for all five cases. 
  

<a name="method4"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::daughter1() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>int Particle::daughter2() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the indices in the event record where the first and last daughters 
are stored, if any. There are five allowed combinations of 
<code>daughter1</code> and <code>daughter2</code>:
<ol>
<li><code>daughter1 = daughter2 = 0</code>: there are no daughters 
(so far);</li>
<li><code>daughter1 = daughter2 > 0</code>: the particle has a 
"carbon copy" as its sole daughter, but with changed momentum 
as a "recoil" effect, e.g. in a shower;</li> 
<li><code>daughter1 > 0, daughter2 = 0</code>: each of the incoming beams 
has only (at most) one daughter, namely the initiator parton of the 
hardest interaction; further, in a <i>2 -> 1</i> hard interaction, 
like <i>q qbar -> Z^0</i>, or in a clustering of two nearby partons, 
the initial partons only have this one daughter;</li> 
<li><code>daughter1 &lt; daughter2</code>, both > 0: the particle has 
a range of decay products from <code>daughter1</code> to 
<code>daughter2</code>;</li> <li><code>daughter2 &lt; daughter1</code>, 
both > 0: the particle has two separately stored decay products (e.g. 
in backwards evolution of initial-state showers).</li>
</ol>
<br/><b>Note 1:</b> in backwards evolution of initial-state showers, the 
daughters may well appear below the mother in the event record. 
<br/><b>Note 2:</b> the mother-daughter relation normally is reciprocal,
but not always. An example is hadron beams (indices 1 and 2), where each 
beam remnant and the initiator of each multiparton interaction has the 
respective beam as mother, but the beam itself only has the initiator 
of the hardest interaction as daughter.
<br/><b>Note 3:</b> the <code>daughterList(i)</code> method of the 
<code>Event</code> class returns a vector of all the daughters, 
providing a uniform representation for all five cases. With this method, 
also all the daughters of the beams are caught, with the initiators of 
the basic process given first,  while the rest are in no guaranteed order 
(since they are found by a scanning of the event record for particles
with the beam as mother, with no further information). 
  

<a name="method5"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::col() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>int Particle::acol() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the colour and anticolour tags, Les Houches Accord [<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">Boo01</a>] 
style (starting from tag 101 by default, see below).
<br/><b>Note:</b> in the preliminary implementation of colour sextets
(exotic BSM particles) that exists since PYTHIA 8.150, a negative
anticolour tag is interpreted as an additional positive colour tag,
and vice versa.  
  

<a name="method6"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::px() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::py() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::pz() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::e() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the particle four-momentum components.
  

<a name="method7"></a>
<p/><strong>Vec4 Particle::p() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the particle four-momentum vector, with components as above.
  

<a name="method8"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::m() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the particle mass, stored with a minus sign (times the absolute value)
for spacelike virtual particles.
  

<a name="method9"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::scale() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the scale at which a parton was produced, which can be used to restrict 
its radiation to lower scales in subsequent steps of the shower evolution. 
Note that scale is linear in momenta, not quadratic (i.e. <i>Q</i>, 
not <i>Q^2</i>). 
  

<a name="method10"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::pol() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the polarization/spin/helicity of a particle. Currently Pythia does not
use this variable for any internal operations, so its meaning is not 
uniquely defined. The LHA standard sets <code>SPINUP</code> to be the 
cosine of the angle between the spin vector and the 3-momentum of the
decaying particle in the lab frame, i.e. restricted to be between +1 
and -1. A more convenient choice could be the same quantity in the rest 
frame of the particle production, either the hard subprocess or the 
mother particle of a decay. Unknown or unpolarized particles should
be assigned the value 9.
  

<a name="method11"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::xProd() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::yProd() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::zProd() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::tProd() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the production vertex coordinates, in mm or mm/c.
  

<a name="method12"></a>
<p/><strong>Vec4 Particle::vProd() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
The production vertex four-vector. Note that the components of a 
<code>Vec4</code> are named <code>px(), py(), pz() and e()</code>
which of course then should be reinterpreted as above. 
  

<a name="method13"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::tau() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the proper lifetime, in mm/c. It is assigned for all hadrons with
positive nominal <i>tau</i>, <i>tau_0 > 0</i>, because it can be used 
by PYTHIA to decide whether a particle should or should not be allowed
to decay, e.g. based on the decay vertex distance to the primary interaction 
vertex.
  

<h3>Input methods</h3>

The same method names as above are also overloaded in versions that 
set values. These have an input argument of the same type as the 
respective output above, and are of type <code>void</code>.

<p/>
There are also a few alternative methods for input:

<a name="method14"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::statusPos() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>void Particle::statusNeg() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
sets the status sign positive or negative, without changing the absolute value.
  

<a name="method15"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::statusCode(int code) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
changes the absolute value but retains the original sign. 
  

<a name="method16"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::mothers(int mother1, int mother2) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
sets both mothers in one go.
  

<a name="method17"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::daughters(int daughter1, int daughter2) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
sets both daughters in one go.
  

<a name="method18"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::cols(int col, int acol) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
sets both colour and anticolour in one go.
  

<a name="method19"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::p(double px, double py, double pz, double e) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
sets the four-momentum components in one go.
  

<a name="method20"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::vProd(double xProd, double yProd, double zProd, double tProd) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
sets the production vertex components in one go.
  

<h3>Further output methods</h3>

<p/>
In addition, a number of derived quantities can easily be obtained, 
but cannot be set, such as:

<a name="method21"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::idAbs() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the absolute value of the particle identity code.
  

<a name="method22"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::statusAbs() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the absolute value of the status code.
  

<a name="method23"></a>
<p/><strong>bool Particle::isFinal() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
true for a remaining particle, i.e. one with positive status code, 
else false. Thus, after an event has been fully generated, it 
separates the final-state particles from intermediate-stage ones. 
(If used earlier in the generation process, a particle then 
considered final may well decay later.)  
  

<a name="method24"></a>
<p/><strong>bool Particle::isRescatteredIncoming() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
true for particles with a status code -34, -45, -46 or -54, else false. 
This singles out partons that have been created in a previous
scattering but here are bookkept as belonging to the incoming state
of another scattering.
  

<a name="method25"></a>
<p/><strong>bool Particle::hasVertex() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
production vertex has been set; if false then production at the origin 
is assumed.
  

<a name="method26"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::m2() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
squared mass, which can be negative for spacelike partons.
  

<a name="method27"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::mCalc() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::m2Calc() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
(squared) mass calculated from the four-momentum; should agree 
with <code>m(), m2()</code> up to roundoff. Negative for spacelike
virtualities.
  

<a name="method28"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::eCalc() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
energy calculated from the mass and three-momentum; should agree 
with <code>e()</code> up to roundoff. For spacelike partons a 
positive-energy  solution is picked. This need not be the correct 
one, so it is recommended not to use the method in such cases.
  

<a name="method29"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::pT() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::pT2() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
(squared) transverse momentum.
  

<a name="method30"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::mT() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::mT2() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
(squared) transverse mass. If <i>m_T^2</i> is negative, which can happen
for a spacelike parton, then <code>mT()</code> returns 
<i>-sqrt(-m_T^2)</i>, by analogy with the negative sign used to store
spacelike masses.  
  

<a name="method31"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::pAbs() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::pAbs2() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
(squared) three-momentum size.
  

<a name="method32"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::eT() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::eT2() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
(squared) transverse energy,
<i>eT = e * sin(theta) = e * pT / pAbs</i>.
  

<a name="method33"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::theta() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::phi() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
polar and azimuthal angle.
  

<a name="method34"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::thetaXZ() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
angle in the <i>(p_x, p_z)</i> plane, between <i>-pi</i> and 
<i>+pi</i>, with 0 along the <i>+z</i> axis 
  

<a name="method35"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::pPos() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::pNeg() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
<i>E +- p_z</i>. 
  

<a name="method36"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::y() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::eta() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
rapidity and pseudorapidity.
  

<a name="method37"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::xDec() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::yDec() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::zDec() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::tDec() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>Vec4 Particle::vDec() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the decay vertex coordinates, in mm or mm/c. This decay vertex is 
calculated from the production vertex, the proper lifetime and the 
four-momentum assuming no magnetic field or other detector interference. 
It can be used to decide whether a decay should be performed or not, 
and thus is defined also for particles which PYTHIA did not let decay.
  

<p/>
Each Particle contains a pointer to the respective 
<code>ParticleDataEntry</code> object in the 
<a href="ParticleDataScheme.html" target="page">particle data tables</a>. 
This gives access to properties of the particle species as such. It is 
there mainly for convenience, and should be thrown if an event is 
written to disk, to avoid any problems of object persistency. Should 
an event later be read back in, the pointer will be recreated from the 
<code>id</code> code if the normal input methods are used. (Use the
<code><a href="EventRecord.html" target="page">Event::restorePtrs()</a></code> method 
if your persistency scheme bypasses the normal methods.) This pointer is 
used by the following member functions:

<a name="method38"></a>

the name of the particle.
  

<a name="method39"></a>
<p/><strong>string Particle::nameWithStatus() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>

brackets to emphasize that they are intermediaries.
  

<a name="method40"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::spinType() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
<i>2 *spin + 1</i> when defined, else 0.
  

<a name="method41"></a>

<strong>bool Particle::isNeutral() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
charge different from or equal to 0.
  

<a name="method43"></a>
<p/><strong>int Particle::colType() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
0 for colour singlets, 1 for triplets, 
-1 for antitriplets and 2 for octets. (A preliminary implementation of
colour sextets also exists, using 3 for sextets and -3 for antisextets.)
  

<a name="method44"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::m0() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the nominal mass of the particle, according to the data tables.
  

<a name="method45"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::mWidth() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::mMin() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double Particle::mMax() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the width of the particle, and the minimum and maximum allowed mass value
for particles with a width, according to the data tables.
  

<a name="method46"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::mass() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the mass of the particle, picked according to a Breit-Wigner 
distribution for particles with width. It is different each time called, 
and is therefore only used once per particle to set its mass
<code>m()</code>.
  

<a name="method47"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::constituentMass() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
will give the constituent masses for quarks and diquarks, 
else the same masses as with <code>m0()</code>.
  

<a name="method48"></a>
<p/><strong>double Particle::tau0() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the nominal lifetime <i>tau_0 > 0</i>, in mm/c, of the particle species. 
It is used to assign the actual lifetime <i>tau</i>.
  

<a name="method49"></a>
<p/><strong>bool Particle::mayDecay() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
flag whether particle has been declared unstable or not, offering 
the main user switch to select which particle species to decay.
  

<a name="method50"></a>
<p/><strong>bool Particle::canDecay() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
flag whether decay modes have been declared for a particle, 
so that it could be decayed, should that be requested.
  

<a name="method51"></a>
<p/><strong>bool Particle::doExternalDecay() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>

<a name="method52"></a>
<p/><strong>bool Particle::isResonance() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
particles where the decay is to be treated as part of the hard process,

<a name="method53"></a>
<p/><strong>bool Particle::isVisible() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
particles with strong or electric charge, or composed of ones having it,

Not part of the <code>Particle</code> class proper, but obviously tightly 
linked, are the two methods 

<a name="method61"></a>
<p/><strong>double m(const Particle& pp1, const Particle& pp2) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>double m2(const Particle& pp1, const Particle& pp2) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
the (squared) invariant mass of two particles.
  

<h3>Methods that perform operations</h3>

There are some further methods, some of them inherited from 
<code>Vec4</code>, to modify the properties of a particle.
They are of little interest to the normal user.

<a name="method62"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::rescale3(double fac) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
multiply the three-momentum components by <code>fac</code>.
  

<a name="method63"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::rescale4(double fac) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
multiply the four-momentum components by <code>fac</code>.
  

<a name="method64"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::rescale5(double fac) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
multiply the four-momentum components and the mass by <code>fac</code>.
  

<a name="method65"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::rot(double theta, double phi) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
rotate three-momentum and production vertex by these polar and azimuthal 
angles.
  

<a name="method66"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::bst(double betaX, double betaY, double betaZ) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
boost four-momentum and production vertex by this three-vector.
  

<a name="method67"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::bst(double betaX, double betaY, double betaZ, double gamma) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
as above, but also input the <i>gamma</i> value, to reduce roundoff errors. 
  

<a name="method68"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::bst(const Vec4& pBst) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
boost four-momentum and production vertex by 
<i>beta = (px/e, py/e, pz/e)</i>.
  

<a name="method69"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::bst(const Vec4& pBst, double mBst) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
as above, but also use <i>gamma> = e/m</i> to reduce roundoff errors.
  

<a name="method70"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::bstback(const Vec4& pBst) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
  
<strong>void Particle::bstback(const Vec4& pBst, double mBst) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
as above, but with sign of boost flipped.
  

<a name="method71"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::rotbst(const RotBstMatrix& M) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
combined rotation and boost of the four-momentum and production vertex.  
  

<a name="method72"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::offsetHistory( int minMother, int addMother, int minDaughter, int addDaughter)) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
add a positive offset to the mother and daughter indices, i.e. 
if <code>mother1</code> is above <code>minMother</code> then 
<code>addMother</code> is added to it, same with <code>mother2</code>,
if <code>daughter1</code> is above <code>minDaughter</code> then 
<code>addDaughter</code> is added to it, same with <code>daughter2</code>.
  

<a name="method73"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::offsetCol( int addCol) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
add a positive offset to colour indices, i.e. if <code>col</code> is 
positive then <code>addCol</code> is added to it, same with <code>acol</code>.
  

<h3>Constructors and operators</h3>

Normally a user would not need to create new particles. However, if 
necessary, the following constructors and methods may be of interest.

<a name="method74"></a>
<p/><strong>Particle::Particle() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
constructs an empty particle, i.e. where all properties have been set 0
or equivalent.
  

<a name="method75"></a>
<p/><strong>Particle::Particle(int id, int status = 0, int mother1 = 0, int mother2 = 0, int daughter1 = 0, int daughter2 = 0, int col = 0, int acol = 0, double px = 0., double py = 0., double pz = 0., double e = 0., double m = 0., double scale = 0., double pol = 9.) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
constructs a particle with the input properties provided, and non-provided
ones set 0 (9 for <code>pol</code>).
  

<a name="method76"></a>
<p/><strong>Particle::Particle(int id, int status, int mother1, int mother2, int daughter1, int daughter2, int col, int acol, Vec4 p, double m = 0., double scale = 0., double pol = 9.) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
constructs a particle with the input properties provided, and non-provided
ones set 0 (9 for <code>pol</code>).
  

<a name="method77"></a>
<p/><strong>Particle::Particle(const Particle& pt) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
constructs an particle that is a copy of the input one.
  

<a name="method78"></a>
<p/><strong>Particle& Particle::operator=(const Particle& pt) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
copies the input particle.
  

<a name="method79"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::setPDTPtr() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
sets the pointer to the <code>ParticleData</code> objects,
i.e. to the full particle data table. Also calls <code>setPDEPtr</code>
below.
  

<a name="method80"></a>
<p/><strong>void Particle::setPDEPtr() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
sets the pointer to the <code>ParticleDataEntry</code> object of the
particle, based on its current <code>id</code> code.
  

<h3>Final notes</h3>

The 
<code><a href="EventRecord.html" target="page">Event</a></code> 
class also contains a few methods defined for individual particles, 
but these may require some search in the event record and therefore 
cannot be defined as  <code>Particle</code> methods.

<p/>
Currently there is no information on polarization states.
