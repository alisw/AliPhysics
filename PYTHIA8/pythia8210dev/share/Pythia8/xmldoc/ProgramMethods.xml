<chapter name="Program Methods"> 
 
<h2>Program Methods</h2> 
 
This is an alphabetical index of all methods that are documented 
elsewhere on these pages, beginning with the few methods that 
do not belong to a class. Many of them are only intended for experts, 
while undocumented ones are only for code authors. 
 
<p/> 
The index is constructed dynamically from the methods described 
on the other webpages, as part of the conversion from xml to 
html and php. Therefore this xml page is only a dummy one.
