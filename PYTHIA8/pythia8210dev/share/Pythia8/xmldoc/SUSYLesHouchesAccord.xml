<h2>SUSY Les Houches Accord</h2> 
 
The PYTHIA 8 program does not contain an internal spectrum calculator 
(a.k.a. RGE package) to provide supersymmetric couplings, mixing angles, 
masses and branching ratios. Thus the SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA) 
<ref>Ska04</ref><ref>All08</ref> is the only way of 
inputting SUSY models, and SUSY processes (see 
the <aloc href="SUSYProcesses">SUSYProcesses</aloc> page) 
cannot be run unless such an input has taken place. 
 
<p/> 
The SLHA input format can also be extended for use with more general BSM 
models, beyond SUSY. Information specific to  how to use the SLHA 
interface for generic BSM models is collected below, 
under <a href="#generic">Using SLHA for generic BSM Models</a>, with 
more elaborate explanations and examples in <ref>Des11</ref>. 
 
<p/> 
Most of the SUSY implementation in PYTHIA 8 is compatible with both the 
SLHA1 <ref>Ska04</ref> and SLHA2 <ref>All08</ref> 
conventions (with some limitations for the NMSSM 
in the latter case). Internally, PYTHIA 8 uses the 
SLHA2 conventions and translates SLHA1 input to these when necessary. 
See the section on SUSY Processes and <ref>Des11</ref> for more 
information. Note that PYTHIA assumes that a spectrum is either fully SHLA1 
or fully SLHA2 compliant. Mixing of the two standards is discouraged, as 
this can lead to ambiguities and inconsistencies. 
 
<p/> 
When reading LHEF files, Pythia automatically looks for SLHA information 
between <code>&lt;slha&gt;...&lt;/slha&gt;</code> tags in the header of such 
files. When running Pythia without LHEF input (or if reading an LHEF 
file that does not contain SLHA information in the header), a separate 
file containing SLHA information may be specified using 
<code>SLHA:file</code> (see below). 
 
<p/> 
Normally the LHEF would be in uncompressed format, and thus human-readable 
if opened in a text editor. A possibility to read gzipped files has 
been added, based on the Boost and zlib libraries, which therefore 
have to be linked appropriately in order for this option to work. 
See the <code>README</code> file in the main directory for details 
on how to do this. 
 
<p/> 
Finally, the SLHA input capability can of course also be used to input 
SLHA-formatted <code>MASS</code> and <code>DECAY</code> tables for 
other particles, such as the Higgs boson, furnishing a less 
sophisticated but more universal complement to the 
standard PYTHIA 8-specific methods for inputting such information (for the 
latter, see the section on <aloc href="ParticleData">Particle Data</aloc> 
and the <aloc href="ParticleDataScheme">scheme</aloc> to modify it). This 
may at times not be desirable, so a few options can be used to curb the right 
of SLHA to overwrite particle data. 
Conversely, it is sometimes useful to allow the user to modify 
eg a mass parameter relative to its value in the SLHA spectrum. 
This is normally not permitted (the SLHA spectrum is normally self-consistent 
and should not be modified), but an option for allowing it is provided. 
 
<p/> 
The reading-in of information from SLHA or LHEF files is handled by the 
<code>SusyLesHouches</code> class, while the subsequent calculation of 
derived quantities of direct application to SUSY processes is done in the 
<code>CoupSUSY</code>, <code>SigmaSUSY</code>, 
and <code>SUSYResonanceWidths</code> classes. 
 
<h3>Sanity Checks</h3> 
 
As an aid for basic validation, some checks and ranges are imposed 
 on SLHA input during initialization, as follows: 
<ul> 
<li>Several parameters (<code>SLHA:keepSM</code>, <code>minMassSM</code>, 
and <code>SLHA:allowUserOverride</code>) provide some safety against 
unintentionally overwriting PYTHIA's Standard-Model information. 
These parameters can be altered to hand over more or less control to the SLHA 
interface. In particular, 
a lot of mass and decay-table information may be included by default in some 
SLHA files, without it being the explicit intention of the user to overwrite 
the corresponding PYTHIA information. The default 
values of the SLHA safety parameters have been chosen so as to eliminate 
at least the most obvious causes of Garbage In Garbage Out. 
(E.g., there is usually no reason to modify the masses of well-measured SM 
particles, like the W and Z bosons, nor to replace their sophisticated 
internal decay treatments by the simplified isotropic treatment used for 
SLHA DECAY tables.) 
</li> 
<li>For SLHA SUSY spectra, the interface checks  the mass-ordering of the 
Higgs, Neutralino, and  Chargino sectors, and the unitarity/orthogonality 
of the mixing matrices. It also performs some additional self-consistency 
checks on whether the correct SLHA BLOCKs for the given SUSY model have been 
included, and whether all required entries have been defined. 
</li> 
<li>If MASS or DECAY information for a particle has been changed by SLHA 
input, the following sanity checks will be carried out. The particle will 
be declared stable unless there is at least one on-shell decay channel open 
(regardless of the presence of any DECAY information). In particular, 
massless particles will always be declared stable. A lower cutoff is imposed 
on the Breit-Wigner shape of the particle, requiring its mass to remain above 
the sum of masses for the lightest decay channel. Subject to that constraint, 
the lower cutoff will normally be placed at 5 times the width (so that the 
default gives a decent sampling of the shape), but the user is allowed to 
use the <code>mMin</code> parameter to choose a larger sampling range if so 
desired (still subject to the on-shell constraint). 
</li> 
<li>For each decay channel in an SLHA DECAY table, PYTHIA will checks the 
available phase space. If the channel is on shell (sum of daughter masses is 
less than mass of decaying particle), then the threshold dependence is given 
by <code>SLHA:meMode</code>. If the channel is off shell, then an 
<code>meMode</code> of 100 is always used. As a further protection against 
GIGO, if the channel appears to be physically impossible (defined as requiring 
fluctuations of more than more than 100 times the effective combined widths), 
it is switched of and a warning message is printed. 
</li> 
<li>DECAY table branching fractions are always interpreted as positive. 
However, a negative sign for one or more channels can be given, and will 
then be interpreted to mean that the corresponding channel(s) should be 
switched off for the current run. This furnishes a simple way to switch 
SLHA DECAY channels on and off while preserving the sum of branching 
fractions equal to unity. 
</li> 
</ul> 
Note that these sanity checks will not catch all possible cases of 
Garbage In Garbage Out, so human verification of the input files is always a 
good idea, as is taking a look at any warnings or error messages printed by 
the SLHA interface during initialization. It is ultimately up to the user to 
ensure that sensible input is being given. 
 
<h3>SLHA Switches and Parameters</h3> 
 
<mode name="SLHA:readFrom" default="1" min="0" max="2"> 
Controls from where SLHA information is read. 
<option value="0">is not read at all. Useful when SUSY is not simulated 
and normal particle properties should not be overwritten.</option> 
<option value="1">read in from the <code>&lt;slha&gt;...&lt;/slha&gt;</code> 
block of a LHEF, if such a file is read during initialization, and else 
from the <code>SLHA:file</code> below.</option> 
<option value="2">read in from the <code>SLHA:file</code> below.</option> 
</mode> 
 
<word name="SLHA:file" default="void"> 
Name of an SLHA (or LHEF) file containing the SUSY/BSM model definition, 
spectra, and (optionally) decay tables. Default <code>void</code> 
signals that no such file has been assigned. 
</word> 
 
<flag name="SLHA:keepSM" default="on"> 
Some programs write SLHA output also for SM particles where normally 
one would not want to have masses and decay modes changed unwittingly. 
Therefore, by default, known SM particles are ignored in SLHA files. 
To be more specific, particle data for identity codes in the ranges 
1 - 24 and 81 - 999,999 are ignored. Notably this includes <ei>Z^0</ei>, 
<ei>W^+-</ei> and <ei>t</ei>. The SM Higgs is modified by the SLHA input, 
as is other codes in the range 25 - 80 and 1,000,000 - . If you 
switch off this flag then also SM particles are modified by SLHA input. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="SLHA:minMassSM" default="100.0"> 
This parameter provides an alternative possibility to ignore SLHA input 
for all particles with identity codes below 1,000,000 (which mainly 
means SM particle, but also includes e.g. the Higgs bosons in 
two-Higgs-doublet scenarios) whose default masses in PYTHIA lie below 
some threshold value, given by this parameter. The default value of 
100.0 allows SLHA input to modify the top quark, but not, e.g., the 
<ei>Z^0</ei> and <ei>W^+-</ei> bosons. 
</parm> 
 
<flag name="SLHA:allowUserOverride" default="off"> 
Flag to set whether the user is allowed to modify the parameters read 
from an SLHA spectrum. Is normally kept <code>off</code> to preserve the 
internal self-consistency of SLHA spectra. If this flag is switched 
<code>on</code>, the mass values read from the SLHA block MASS are 
allowed to be modified by the user, using PYTHIA's standard 
<code>readString</code> and related methods. 
</flag> 
 
<h3>SLHA DECAY Tables</h3> 
 
In addition to SUSY spectra, the SLHA also defines a set of conventions for 
decay tables. These are not restricted to SUSY models, but can be used for 
arbitrary particles, either in combination with or independently of 
the SUSY parts of the Accord. The settings in this section control whether and 
how PYTHIA will make use of such tables. See also the comments under 
sanity checks above. 
<note>Note</note>: the PYTHIA SLHA interface is limited to at most 
<code>1&rarr;8</code> decays. 
 
<flag name="SLHA:useDecayTable" default="on"> 
Switch to choose whether to read in SLHA <code>DECAY</code> tables or not. 
If this switch is set to off, PYTHIA will ignore any decay tables found 
in the SLHA file, and all decay widths will be calculated internally by 
PYTHIA. If switched on, SLHA decay tables will be read in, and will 
then supersede PYTHIA's internal calculations, with PYTHIA only 
computing the decays for particles for which no SLHA decay table is 
found. (To set a particle stable, you may either omit an SLHA 
<code>DECAY</code> table for it and then 
use PYTHIA's internal <code>id:MayDecay</code> switch for that 
particle, or you may include an SLHA <code>DECAY</code> table for it, 
with the width set explicitly to zero.) 
</flag> 
 
<mode name="SLHA:meMode" default="100" min="100" max="103"> 
This value specifies how threshold, off-shell, and phase-space 
weighting effects for SLHA decay channels should be treated, using the same 
numbering scheme as for <aloc href="ResonanceDecays">resonances</aloc>. 
The default (100) is to use the branching fraction given in the SLHA 
DECAY tables without any modifications. The 
corresponding partial widths remain unchanged 
when the resonance fluctuates in mass. Specifically there are no 
threshold corrections. That is, if the resonance fluctuates down in 
mass, to below the nominal threshold for some decay mode, 
it is assumed that one of the 
daughters could also fluctuate down to keep the channel open. (If not, 
there may be problems later on.) 
Alternative options (with values 101+) documented under 
<aloc href="ResonanceDecays">resonances</aloc> allow for some flexibility to 
apply threshold factors expressing the closing of the on-shell phase space 
when the daughter masses approach or exceed the parent one. 
Note that modes that are extremely far off shell 
(defined as needing a fluctuation of more than 100 times the 
root-sum-square of the widths of the mother and daughter particles) 
will always be assigned <code>meMode = 100</code> and should be 
switched off by hand if so desired. 
It is up 
to the user to ensure that the final behaviour is consistent with what 
is desired (and/or to apply suitable post facto reweightings). 
Plotting the generator-level resonance and decay-product mass 
distributions (and e.g., mass differences), effective branching 
fractions, etc, may be of assistance to validate the behaviour of the 
program. 
</mode> 
 
<h3>Internal SLHA Variables</h3> 
 
<mode name="SLHA:verbose" default="1" min="0" max="3"> 
Controls amount of text output written by the SLHA interface, with a 
value of 0 corresponding to the most quiet mode. 
</mode> 
 
The following variables are used internally by PYTHIA as local copies 
of SLHA information. User changes will generally have no effect, since 
these variables will be reset by the SLHA reader during initialization. 
 
<flag name="SLHA:NMSSM" default="off"> 
Corresponds to SLHA block MODSEL entry 3. 
</flag> 
 
<a name="generic"></a> 
<h2>Using SLHA for generic BSM Models</h2> 
 
</p> 
Using the <code>QNUMBERS</code> extension <ref>Alw07</ref>, the SLHA 
can also be used to define new particles, with arbitrary quantum 
numbers. This already serves as a useful way to introduce new 
particles and can be combined with <code>MASS</code> and 
<code>DECAY</code> tables in the usual 
way, to generate isotropically distributed decays or even chains of 
such decays. (If you want something better than isotropic, sorry, you'll 
have to do some actual work ...) 
</p> 
 
</p> 
A more advanced further option is to make use of the possibility 
in the SLHA to include user-defined blocks with arbitrary 
names and contents. Obviously, standalone 
PYTHIA 8 does not know what to do with such information. However, it 
does not throw it away either, but instead stores the contents of user 
blocks as strings, which can be read back later, with the user 
having full control over the format used to read the individual entries. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The contents of both standard and user-defined SLHA blocks can be accessed 
in any class inheriting from PYTHIA 8's <code>SigmaProcess</code> 
class (i.e., in particular, from any semi-internal process written by 
a user), through its SLHA pointer, <code>slhaPtr</code>, by using the 
following methods: 
<pre> 
bool slhaPtr->getEntry(string blockName, double& val); 
bool slhaPtr->getEntry(string blockName, int indx, double& val); 
bool slhaPtr->getEntry(string blockName, int indx, int jndx, double& val); 
bool slhaPtr->getEntry(string blockName, int indx, int jndx, int kndx, double& val); 
</pre> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
This particular example assumes that the user wants to read the 
entries (without index, indexed, matrix-indexed, or 3-tensor-indexed, 
respectively) in the user-defined block <code>blockName</code>, 
and that it should be interpreted as 
a <code>double</code>. The last argument is templated, and hence if 
anything other than a <code>double</code> is desired to be read, the 
user has only to give the last argument a different type. 
If anything went wrong (i.e., the block doesn't 
exist, or it doesn't have an entry with that index, or that entry 
can't be read as a double), the method returns false; true 
otherwise. This effectively allows to input completely arbitrary 
parameters using the SLHA machinery, with the user having full control 
over names and conventions. Of course, it is then the user's 
responsibility to ensure complete consistency between the names and 
conventions used in the SLHA input, and those assumed in any 
user-written semi-internal process code. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Note that PYTHIA 8 always initializes at least 
the SLHA blocks MASS and SMINPUTS, starting from its internal 
SM parameters and particle data table values (updated to take into 
account user modifications). These blocks can therefore be accessed 
using the <code>slhaPtr->getEntry()</code> methods even in the absence 
of SLHA input. 
Note: in the SMINPUTS block, PYTHIA outputs physically correct 
(i.e., measured) values of <ei>GF</ei>, <ei>m_Z</ei>, and 
<ei>alpha_EM(m_Z)</ei>. However, if one attempts to compute, e.g., 
the W mass, at one loop from these quantities, a value of 79 GeV results, 
with a corresponding value for the weak mixing angle. We advise to 
instead take the physically measured W mass from block MASS, and 
recompute the EW parameters as best suited for the application at hand.
