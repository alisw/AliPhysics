<h2>Update History</h2> 
 
These update notes describe major updates relative to the 
PYTHIA 8.186 version, which was the last regular 8.1 release. 
(Minor bug fixes will continue to appear.) The step from 
8.1 to 8.2 gave an occasion to break backwards compatibility, 
but this should only affect a small part of the user code. 
 
<h3>Main news by version</h3> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>8.205: 23 January 2015 
<ul> 
 
<li>Unfortunate tiny typo made the new A14 tunes inaccessible.
Now fixed.</li> 
 
<li>Resolved an inconsistency between MLM and FxFx merging that was 
introduced in 8.201 upon answering a user request. The effect should 
be minimal. Thanks to Josh Bendavid for bringing this to our attention.
</li> 
 
<li>Amended the automated reading of the (optional) 
"TimeShower:nPartonsInBorn" setting from Les Houches Event files 
produced with aMC@NLO. Heavy coloured objects are now handled correctly 
when the information in the Les Houches event does not include heavy 
partons of the lowest-multiplicity state into its counting (as is 
conventional). Thanks to Josh Bendavid for pointing this out.</li> 
 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>8.204: 22 January 2015 
<ul> 
 
<li>The <code>examples</code> directory has been moved back from
the <code>share/Pythia8/</code> subdirectory to the main directory,
as was the case in PYTHIA 8.1, to make it more visible to newcomers.
The optional <code>make install</code> step will create a copy of 
<code>examples</code> in <code>share/Pythia8/</code>. The rarely
used <code>examples/outref</code> subdirectory is moved to 
<code>share/Pythia8/outref</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Fifteen new <a href="Tunes.html" target="page">tunes</a> have been added, 
the MonashStar tune from CMS and fourteen A14 tunes from ATLAS 
[<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">ATL14a</a>]. The latter correspond to central tunes for 
four different PDF sets and ten variations in five (approximate) 
eigenvector directions. Furthermore, now the chosen 
<code>Tune:pp</code> implies the <code>Tune:ee</code> value 
to which it is related, and thus the latter need not be set 
separately.</li> 
 
<li>Default settings values have been updated to agree with the 
Monash 2013 tune. Thus typically the list of changed settings is 
significantly reduced. Thanks to Mikhail Kirsanov for suggestion.</li> 
 
<li>The compositeness section has been expanded with six further 
processes, describing the pair production of excited leptons or 
neutrinos. Three-body contact-interaction decay modes of these 
excited states have been introduced. A bug has been fixed that 
gave the wrong helicity in decays for excited quarks, leptons and 
neutrinos. Further, the <i>gamma^*/Z^0/Z'^0</i> can decay to a pair
of excited fermions provided that the channels are added to the 
list of allowed ones. Based on code provided by Olga Igonkina.</li> 
 
<li>A new interface to the EvtGen decay package, primarily intended 
for bottom and charm decays, has been implemented. It is available 
in <code>include/Pythia8Plugins/EvtGen.h</code> and an example how 
to set it up is found in <code>main48</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Several minor changes in the <code>examples</code> subdirectory. 
This includes the <code>README</code>, <code>Makefile</code> an 
<code>runmains</code> files. The <code>main61</code> example program 
has been removed, since now LHAPDF can be loaded dynamically for 
<code>main42</code>, so that the two become equivalent. Further 
<code>main62</code> has been renamed <code>main43</code>, to gather 
HepMC-related examples, and <code>testlhef3.lhe</code> has been 
renamed <code>wbj_lhef3.lhe</code>. 
</li> 
 
<li>A new example <code>main30</code> how to create a tailormade 
copy of the ordinary event record, here with a history tracing 
of the hard process closer to the PYTHIA 6 conventions.</li> 
 
<li>The <a href="ProMCFiles.html" target="page">ProMC</a> input-output file format
is now implemented among the libraries that can be 
<code>configure</code>d to run with PYTHIA. An examples is provided
in <code>main46.cc</code>. Thanks to Sergei Chekanov.</li> 
 
<li>Change in the setup of final-state-shower colour dipoles for the 
non-default case of no interleaving, whereby it becomes less likely 
to pick a colourless final-state particle as recoiler. New option
<code>TimeShower:allowMPIdipole</code> gives more flexibility.
Thanks to Mihoko Nojiri and Bryan Webber.</li> 
 
<li>New options 3 and 4 for <code>TimeShower:pTdampMatch</code>
and <code>SpaceShower:pTdampMatch</code>, with new default 3 for the
latter. The main effect is that, by default, <i>t tbar</i> 
production (as a <i>2 &rarr; 2</i> process) obtains damped 
radiation above the process scale. Thanks to Andy Buckley
for suggestion.</li> 
 
<li>Initialization will now abort if a mode has been chosen with a 
non-allowed value. This applies to those modes that have been 
defined with the <code>modepick</code> or <code>modefix</code> 
labels in the <code>xmldoc/*.xml</code> files and, for the former, 
where maximal and minimal values have been specified. The former 
label is used to represent a discrete set of options, and so any 
value outside the allowed range is just plain wrong. Thanks to James 
Monk for suggestion.</li> 

<li>Added <code>getChannels()</code> in <code>SusyResonanceWidths</code> 
to dynamically create the decay table for SUSY particles and thereby
to remove duplication in the XML file.</li> 

<li>New file <code>SusyWidthfunctions</code>. Added new class 
<code>WidthFunction</code> to handle calculation of three- and four-body 
decay widths.</li>  

<li>In <code>main24.cc</code> the example spectrum file format has been 
updated from SLHA1 to SLHA2, obtained from SoftSusy 3.5.1. The two new
<code>slha1-example.spc</code> and <code>slha2-example.spc</code> files
replace the older <code>cmssm.spc</code>, <code>snowmass2.spc</code> 
and <code>softsusy.spc</code> ones. </li> 

<li>In <code>LesHouches.cc</code> the read-in of LHEF headers 
containing tags that open and close on the same line (e.g., a single 
line containing <code>&lt;tag&gt;blabla&lt;/tag&gt;</code>) has been 
enabled. This could previously lead to improper initialization and 
crashes. Also implemented a check for forgotten close-tag statements, 
with a warning issued to the user. Thanks to Alexander Belyaev and 
Alexander Pukhov.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix in the conversion from the <code>xml</code> settings files 
to their <code>php</code> radio-button equivalents, whereby the text 
describing some options was not set properly. (Typically the text of 
the previous option was repeated.) Thanks to Radek Ziebcik.</li> 
 
<li>Minor fixes in the LHEF version 3 reader. Introduce a new 
matching writer of LHEF version 1 or 3 files.</li> 
 
<li>Introduction of a new mode <code>LesHouches:setLeptonMass</code>,
such that by default final-state charged leptons acquire sensible 
masses, even when the matrix-element calculations have been 
performed with massless leptons. This and other energy-momentum
adjustments, e.g. for limited-precision storage, are now located in
<code>ProcessContainer::constructProcess</code>.</li> 

<li><code>http://home.thep.lu.se/Pythia</code> has been introduced 
as a simpler but (hopefully) equivalent address to
<code>http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html</code>, and 
various documentation has been updated accordingly. Thanks to
Leif L&ouml;nnblad.</li> 

<li>New file <code>include/Pythia8Plugins/execinfo.h</code> contains
trivial copies of three backtrace methods needed to be able to compile
PYTHIA under Cygwin. The <code>README</code> file and the worksheet
updated with brief information on three (non-supported) ways of working 
with PYTHIA under Windows. Thanks to and Theo Hughes and Gordon Watts.
</li> 

<li>Bug fix in check for colour sextets and transfer of such colour 
information. Thanks to Alexander Belyaev and Alexander Pukhov.</li> 
 
<li>Improved handling of stray characters in the SUSY Les Houches 
code. The check on the consistency of decay tables has been removed. 
Improved warning/error printing in the SLHA interface.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix in new beam remnant model, so that it basically 
operates like the old one for <i>e^+e^-</i> annihilation.</li> 
 
<li>Two bug fixes in the new colour reconnection model, one for 
diquarks at the ends of junction strings, and another to check that 
coloured resonances are processes with early resonance decays option.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix for multiple <code>Pythia::init()</code> calls, where 
beam contents were not properly reset. Thanks to Josh Bendavid.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix such that the valence content of a <i>pi^0</i>,
<i>K^0_S</i>, <i>K^0_L</i> and Pomeron is reselected for each
new event. Thanks to Radek Ziebcik.</li>
 
<li>Fix typo in constants of the <i>tau &rarr; 3 pi</i> current 
for the amplitudes of the <i>rho</i>, <i>rho(1450)</i>, and 
<i>f2</i>. Thanks to Ian Nugent.</li> 
 
<li>Small bug fixes for string and ministring fragmentation, for the 
case when a low-mass (order 2 GeV) system contains at least three
partons, which fail to define a unique direction for the final
string region.</li> 
 
<li>New parameter <code>BeamRemnants:reducedKTatHighY</code> introduced
to reduce technical problems with low-mass MPIs produced at high
rapidities when primordial <i>kT</i> is introduced.</li> 
 
<li>Small bug fix in the global-recoil option for timelike showers.</li> 
 
<li>Update year to 2015, remove tabs and superfluous blanks, break long 
lines where meaningful, and some further minor changes.</li> 
 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>8.201: 14 October 2014 
<ul> 
 
<li>The <i>Introduction to PYTHIA 8.2</i> has now been assigned 
the arXiv:1410.3012 [hep-ph] identifier, which has been introduced 
in code and text.</li> 
 
<li>The <code>enable-shared</code> by mistake was not listed 
among allowed configure options.</li> 
 
<li>Corrected a few tiny documentation typos.</li> 
 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>8.200: 11 October 2014 
<ul> 
 
<li>A new <code>share/Pythia8</code> directory collects all 
documentation and example code. The <code>examples</code>, 
<code>htmldoc</code>, <code>phpdoc</code> and <code>xmldoc</code> 
directories have been moved here. The main-directory files 
<code>AUTHORS</code>, <code>COPYING</code>, <code>GUIDELINE</code> 
and <code>README</code> are also copied here during installation. 
</li> 
 
<li>A new <code>share/Pythia8/pdfdoc</code> directory collects pdf 
documents that are linked from the <code>htmldoc</code> and 
<code>phpdoc</code> directories. Over time it will  provide more 
in-depth descriptions of various physics aspects than offered in 
the html/php-formatted documentation. In addition to the official 
main publication and the worksheet, currently notes on LO vs. NLO 
PDFs and on the <i>g &rarr; q qbar</i> branching kernel are 
included.</li> 
 
<li>A new <code>include/Pythia8Plugins</code> directory collects 
code that does not form part of the core PYTHIA functionality but 
still has a general usefulness. Code in this directory will not be 
compiled as part of the Pythia library, but can be linked where needed. 
This new directory contains 
<ul> 
<li>the jet matching classes in <code>CombineMatchingInput.h</code>, 
<code>GeneratorInput.h</code> and <code>JetMatching.h</code>, moved 
from the <code>examples</code> directory;</li> 
<li>the <code>PowhegHooks</code> user hook, to veto shower emissions 
above the POWHEG scale, formerly found in <code>examples/main31.cc</code>; 
</li> 
<li>the <code>Pythia8ToHepMC</code> interface for output of PYTHIA events 
into the HepMC format, combining the code previously in 
<code>include/Pythia8ToHepMC.h</code> and 
<code>pythia8tohepmc/Pythia8ToHepMC.cc</code> into a new 
<code>HepMC2.h</code> file;</li> 
<li>the <code>FastJet3.h</code> interface of PYTHIA particles to the 
FastJet 3 library of jet finders, formerly found in 
<code>include/FastJet3.h</code>; and</li> 
<li>the <code>LHAPDF5.h</code> and <code>LHAPDF6.h</code> files for 
interfaces to the LHAPDF library (see further below).</li> 
</ul></li> 
 
<li>The configure/make structure has been considerably rewritten. 
Now all external libraries to be linked are specified in the 
main-directory <code>configure</code> step, along with other options, 
so there is no longer an <code>examples/configure</code>. The 
<code>make</code> step will, as before, compile and install libraries 
inside the current directory, such that the main programs in the 
<code>examples</code> directory can be run. One small difference is that 
also the archive libraries are installed in <code>lib</code> and not in 
<code>lib/archive</code>. 
<br/>A new optional <code>make install</code> step allows you to copy 
files to more convenient locations. The default option, with no directories 
specified in the <code>configure</code> step, requires you to have 
superuser privileges. Then files will be copied to standard locations 
as follows: 
<table border="0"> 
  <tr> <td>lib/</td> <td>&rarr;&nbsp;</td> <td>/usr/lib/</td> </tr> 
  <tr> <td>include/</td> <td>&rarr;&nbsp;</td> <td>/usr/include/</td> </tr> 
  <tr> <td>share/</td> <td>&rarr;&nbsp;</td> <td>/usr/share/</td> </tr> 
  <tr> <td>pythia-config</td> <td>&rarr;&nbsp;</td> <td>/usr/bin/</td> </tr> 
</table> 
</li> 
 
<li> 
The <code>pythia8-config.in</code> script has been replaced by a new 
<code>bin/pythia8-config</code> script. See the README file for details. 
The <code>make install</code> step by default will put a copy of it in 
<code>/usr/bin</code>. 
</li> 
 
<li>The interface to LHAPDF is now dynamically loaded when requested, 
and can be either to version 5 or 6 of the library. The dummy code 
previously in <code>lhapdfdummy/LHAPDFDummy.cc</code>, to be linked 
when LHAPDF is not, is no longer required. The two new files 
<code>LHAPDF5.h</code> and <code>LHAPDF6.h</code> in the 
<code>include/Pythia8Plugins</code> directory contain the necessary 
interface code. The selection of PDF sets, notably for the proton, 
has been extended to simplify mixing of internal and external PDF sets, 
and it is now possible to specify different PDFs for the two incoming 
protons at the LHC, see the <a href="PDFSelection.html" target="page">PDF Selection</a> 
description.</li> 
 
<li>The new <code>LHEF3.h</code> file contains a generic interface for 
reading Les Houches Event Files of versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. This 
allows more information to be read and studied by the author. Currently 
PYTHIA itself makes little use of the information beyond the one in 1.0, 
but it is available among the 
<a href="EventInformation.html" target="page">Event Information</a>. 
Examples are found in <code>main37.cc</code> and <code>main38.cc</code>. 
</li> 
 
<li>The new <code>Beams:strictLHEFscale</code> switch can be used to 
restrict parton showers in resonance decays to be below the input 
Les Houches scale, not only the hard process itself. 
The new <code>Beams:setProductionScalesFromLHEF</code> switch can be used 
to restrict the emission off each separate parton to be below its specific 
scale.</li> 
 
<li>The <code>rootexamples</code> directory has been removed, and the 
two programs <code>examples/main91</code> and <code>examples/main92</code> 
now illustrate how ROOT can be used in conjunction with PYTHIA.</li> 
 
<li>The executable built from <code>examples/mainxx.cc</code> is now 
named <code>examples/mainxx</code>, while previously it was named 
<code>examples/mainxx.exe</code>.</li> 
 
<li>The rudimentary support for compilation on Windows platforms, 
present in PYTHIA 8.1, has not yet been updated for 8.2 and so is omitted. 
Also the README.HepMC file is omitted for now.</li> 
 
<li>The ProMC interface is broken, and has been removed for now.</li> 
 
<li>Several methods have been removed from the <code>Event</code> class 
since the properties now instead can be accessed from the individual 
<code>Particle</code> instance, if this particle belongs to an event. 
These include <code>iTopCopy</code>, <code>iBotCopy</code>, 
<code>iTopCopyId</code>, <code>iBotCopyId</code>,<code>motherList</code>, 
<code>daughterList</code>, <code>sisterList</code>, 
<code>sisterListTopBot</code>, <code>isAncestor</code>, 
<code>statusHepMC</code> and <code>undoDecay</code>.</li> 
 
<li>A number of deprecated <code>Pythia::init(...)</code> methods with 
varying arguments have been removed. Instead call <code>init()</code> 
without any arguments and use 
<a href="BeamParameters.html" target="page">Beam Parameters</a> settings to 
specify beams and energies in different ways.</li> 
 
<li>The deprecated <code>Pythia::statistics(...)</code> method has been 
removed; instead use <code>Pythia::stat(...)</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Several settings in the <code>Main:</code> series have been removed. 
Most of these have already found replacements in the <code>Init:</code>, 
<code>Next:</code> and <code>Stat:</code> ones, and have been marked as 
deprecated. Four further ones were deemed so peripheral that they were 
removed altogether, but of course the underlying functionality remains. 
</li> 
 
<li>A few aliases for (parts of) settings names have been removed. 
Previously "Multiple" was mapped to "Multiparton", "MI" to "MPI" and 
"minBias" to "nonDiffractive" if a settings name was not found for the 
original input string.</li> 
 
<li>The default tune has been changed from 4C to Monash 2013, meaning 
<code>Tune:ee = 7</code> and <code>Tune:pp = 14</code>. The old 4C 
tune that was default in 8.1 can be recovered with 
<code>Tune:ee = 3</code> and <code>Tune:pp = 5</code>. 
Also most other older tunes are based on <code>Tune:ee = 3</code>. 
</li> 
 
<li>Two new CMS underlying-event tunes [<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">CMS14</a>] and the ATLAS 
AZ tune [<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">ATL14</a>] have been added as options.</li> 
 
<li>The default handling of the <i>g &rarr; q qbar</i> splitting kernel 
has been changed, affecting in particular heavy-flavour production. 
<code>TimeShower:weightGluonToQuark</code> has been changed from 1 to 4 
to do this. All old tunes are with the 1 value but, since the tunes are 
not probing the detailed <i>g &rarr; q qbar</i> behaviour, this is 
not set as part of the tune options.</li> 
 
<li>Christine O. Rasmussen joins as new PYTHIA collaboration member.</li> 
 
<li>A new model for the handling of <a href="BeamRemnants.html" target="page">beam 
remnants</a> as an option to the old one, which remains as default 
for now.</li> 
 
<li>Two new models for <a href="ColourReconnection.html" target="page">colour 
reconnection</a>, one quite sophisticated and one simpler. 
This involves several new classes and files. It also includes some 
changes in the hadronization framework, notably for the handling of 
junctions. The old model remains as default for now. The 
<code>BeamRemnants:reconnectColours</code> flag to switch on/off 
reconnection has been renamed <code>ColourReconnection:reconnect</code>, 
the main parameter <code>BeamRemnants:reconnectRange</code> of the old 
model has been renamed <code>ColourReconnection:range</code>, and several 
new settings have been introduced, notably 
<code>ColourReconnection:mode</code> to switch among the three models. 
</li> 
 
<li>A new <code>include/Pythia8Plugins/ColourReconnectionHooks.h</code> 
makes available an even larger selection of toy colour reconnection 
models, via user hooks. Some of them are only intended for top decays, 
for top mass uncertainty studies, whereas others can be used more 
generally. The <code>examples/main29.cc</code> program illustrates how 
the different options should be set up.</li> 
 
<li>Several new features and improvements in the matching/merging 
machinery. Notably the aMC@NLO matching scheme has been implemented, 
see the <a href="aMCatNLOMatching.html" target="page">aMC@NLO Matching</a> 
description. To this end the global-recoil option of timelike showers 
has been improved, and security checks have been introduced for 
inaccurate LHEF input. A new <code>main89.cc</code> example has been 
introduced, where different <code>.cmnd</code> files show how to set 
up either CKKW-L, FxFx, MLM, UMEPS or UNLOPS merging.</li> 
 
<li>Improved capability for the <code>LHAup</code> Les Houches interface 
to read SLHA information embedded in the input file or stream.</li> 
 
<li>The <code>Makefile</code>s have been updated to take into account 
the changed structure of the HepMC interface.</li> 
 
<li>The <i>Z'</i> production process has been updated to optionally 
allow decay to a fourth generation of fermions, with universal or 
non-universal couplings.</li> 
 
<li>Introduction of a new Higgs CP-mixing parametrization via a mixing 
angle <i>phi</i> as described in <a href="HiggsProcesses.html" target="page">Higgs 
Processes</a>. The choice of the Higgs CP-mixing parametrization 
now also affects the distributions of the <i>tau</i> decay products 
from the processes <i>H^0 &rarr; tau^+ tau^-</i>. 
 
<li>Bug fix in <i>H^0 &rarr; W^+ W^- &rarr; 4 f</i> matrix element 
for mixed CP-state case.</li> 
 
<li>Various improvements and finer grain control for the determination 
of <i>tau</i> decay correlations and <i>tau</i> polarizations. By 
default the decays of <i>tau</i> pairs from known resonance decays 
in Les Houches input are now correlated. 
The <code>ParticleDecays:sophisticatedTau</code> mode 
in <a href="ParticleDecays.html" target="page">Particle Decays</a> has been renamed 
<code>TauDecays:mode</code>, as well as all <i>tau</i>-related 
<code>ParticleDecay</code> options, with two new options of 
using only the internal machinery to determine correlations and 
polarizations, and only using the provided SPINUP digit from Les 
Houches input. The option <code>TauDecays:externalMode</code> has been 
introduced to control the interpretation of the SPINUP digit. 
</li> 
 
<li>For Les Houches Event input the energy of a particle is recalculated 
from its three-momentum and mass, in order to limit mismatches from 
limited numerical precision in the input values.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix in the two-loop running <i>alpha_s</i>, for the matching 
to six flavours at the top mass.</li> 
 
<li>Eliminate harmless compiler warnings for <code>FJcore</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Updated Introduction (= the official 8.2 article) and Worksheet.</li>
