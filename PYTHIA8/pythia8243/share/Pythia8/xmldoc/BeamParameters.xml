<chapter name="Beam Parameters"> 
 
<h2>Beam Parameters</h2> 
 
The settings on this page relate to the beam identities and energies, 
to a beam momentum spread and to a beam interaction spot. 
As always, momenta and energies are to be given in units of GeV, 
and of space and time in mm. 
 
<h3>Incoming beams</h3> 
 
The identities and energies of the two incoming beam particles 
should be specified using the settings in this section. 
Note that, if nothing is done, you will default to LHC at 14 TeV. 
 
<p/> 
Currently the beam particles must be either a hadron pair, a lepton 
pair, a photon pair, a lepton and a hadron or a photon and a hadron. 
In the first category <ei>p p</ei> and <ei>pbar p</ei> 
combinations dominate, but it is also possible to combine with 
<ei>pi^+</ei>, <ei>pi^-</ei> and <ei>pi^0</ei>. In the second 
<ei>e^+ e^-</ei> and <ei>mu^+ mu^-</ei> would be the most useful 
combinations, but also others should work if combined with an 
appropriate hard process. 
 
<modeopen name="Beams:idA" default="2212"> 
The PDG <code>id</code> code for the first incoming particle. 
Allowed codes include 
<br/><ei>2212 = p</ei>, <ei>-2212 = pbar</ei>, 
<br/><ei>2112 = n</ei>, <ei>-2112 = nbar</ei>, 
<br/><ei>211 = pi^+</ei>, <ei>-211 = pi^-</ei>, <ei>111 = pi^0</ei>, 
<br/><ei>990 = Pomeron</ei> (used in diffractive machinery; 
here mainly for debug purposes), 
<br/><ei>22 = gamma</ei> (for <ei>gamma-gamma</ei> and <ei>gamma-hadron</ei> 
interactions, more info <aloc href="Photoproduction">here</aloc>), 
<br/><ei>11 = e^-</ei>, <ei>-11 = e^+</ei>, 
<br/><ei>13 = mu^-</ei>, <ei>-13 = mu^+</ei>, 
<br/>and a few more leptons/neutrinos in a few combinations. 
<br/>Recently <aloc href="HeavyIons">heavy-ion collisions</aloc> have 
been implemented in PYTHIA. Therefore a handful of nuclei have been 
added as allowed incoming beams, using PDG codes of the format 
<code>100ZZZAAAI</code>: 
1000020040 = <sup>4</sup>He , 1000030060 = <sup>6</sup>Li, 
1000060120 = <sup>12</sup>C, 1000080160 = <sup>16</sup>O, 
1000290630 = <sup>63</sup>Cu, 1000791970 = <sup>197</sup>Au, and 
1000822080 = <sup>208</sup>Pb. More can be added using the function 
<code>ParticleData::addParticle</code>.

<h3>Variable collision energy</h3> 
 
There are two different machineries that can provide an event-by-event 
spread of collision energies. The one in this section is intended 
to allow for very large variations in collision energy, more-or-less 
from threshold to the highest LHC/FCC/cosmic-ray energies. This is made 
possible by interpolation in a grid of CM energies. Such a strategy 
requires the processes to have a smooth and well-understood energy 
dependence. In practice this limits us to the soft QCD processes 
betweeen two incoming hadrons. Thus the framework is convenient e.g. 
for studies of cosmic-ray cascades, or for secondary collisions in 
general. 
 
<p/> 
The core extension in this option is that the multiparticle interactions 
(MPI) machinery is initialized over a (logarithmically spaced) grid of 
collision energies, from the maximal energy provided at the 
initialization down to a lower cutoff (see <code>eMinPert</code> below). 
For each new event, with a new CM energy, a suitable interpolation is 
then performed among the generation coefficients determined at 
initialization. The MPI framework is what is needed to simulate 
hadronic nondiffractive events (<code>SoftQCD:nonDiffractive</code>). 
Pretty much the same strategy is already used for diffraction, to handle 
MPIs inside the variable-mass diffractive systems. Thus all the 
<aloc href="QCDProcesses">Soft QCD processes</aloc> can be used 
within this framework. It is not possible to generate other processes 
with this framework, however, and the program will abort if you try. 
 
<p/> 
The initalization of involves setting up optimal coefficients for 
the kinematics selection in the subsequent MPI generation, and 
finding the associated maximum of the differentialcross section. 
At a fixed energy this typically takes less than a second, and so 
normally is not noticeable.It is a major fraction of the full PYTHIA 
initialization time, however. Thus the initialization over a grid of 
energies raises the total initialization time appreciable, to the order 
of ten seconds. Initialization of diffraction contributes comparable 
numbers, when switched on. You should therefore not be surprised that 
the startup time is longer than usual. The subsequent event generation 
should not become noticeably slower, however. 
 
<p/> 
There are three main settings in this framework. 
 
<flag name="Beams:allowVariableEnergy" default="off"> 
Master switch to allow collision energies below the initialization one, 
as described above. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="Beams:eMinPert" default="10." min="10."> 
The lowest CM energy that collisions are allowed to have. The highest 
is set by the full energy at initialization, as calculated in the 
respective options above. If you do not want to generate events with 
a higher collision energy than this you can save some initialization 
time by raising this number accordingly, so that fewer grid energies need 
to be used. You should not lower the value below the default one, however, 
since the perturbative MPI machinery cannot be made to work at lower 
energies. If you do want to generate events with lower energies, it 
is possible in a nonperturbative framework, see next. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="Beams:eWidthPert" default="10." min="1."> 
A simpler low-mass description can be used for energies below the 
threshold energy <ei>e_min</ei> = <code>eMinPert</code> above, with 
only longitudinally stretched strings. A gradual switch-over between 
the simple low-energy and perturbative high-energy regimes is then 
natural. The probability for the latter picture is parametrized as 
<eq> 
P_pert = 1 - exp( (e_CM - e_min) / e_width ) 
</eq> 
which vanishes for the CM energy <ei>e_CM &lt; e_min</ei>, and is 
<ei>1 - 1/e = 0.632</ei> for <ei>e_CM = e_min + e_width</ei>. 
The current parameter is this <ei>e_width.</ei> 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
To input the variable energy, the normal argument-less 
<code>Pythia::next()</code> method has three siblings that take 
relevent arguments as required by the <code>Beams:frameType</code>. 
 
<method name="bool Pythia::next(double eCM)"> 
events created by the collision of two particles coming in along the 
<ei>+-z</ei> axis in their common rest frame, with the CM energy as 
argument, to be used for <code>Beams:frameType = 1</code>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="bool Pythia::next(double eA, double eB)"> 
events created by the collision of two particles coming in along the 
<ei>+-z</ei> axis, with the respective energies as arguments, to be 
used for <code>Beams:frameType = 2</code>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="bool Pythia::next(double pxA, double pyA, double pzA, 
double pxB, double pyB, double pzB)"> 
events created by two incoming particles with arbitrary three-momenta, 
to be used for <code>Beams:frameType = 3</code>. 
</method> 
 
 
<h3>Beam momentum spread</h3> 
 
This framework currently is intended for a modest beam spread, such as 
experienced at hadron colliders. Thus it can be safely assumed that the 
physics does not change over the CM energy range probed, so that the 
parameters of the physics initialization at the nominal energy can be 
used as is. Therefore it can be used for all processes implemented in 
PYTHIA. It can <b>not</b> be used for the more extensive energy spread, 
however, e.g. as expected at linear <ei>e^+ e^-</ei> colliders. Also, 
any attempt to combine it with external Les Houches input of 
parton-level events is at own risk. This option cannot be combined with 
the variable-collision-energy option above, but will be switced off in 
such a case. 
 
<p/> 
On this page you can set the momentum spread according to a simple 
Gaussian distribution. If you instead want a more sophisticated 
parametrization, you can write and link your own 
<code><aloc href="BeamShape">BeamShape</aloc></code> class.

<h3>Beam interaction vertex</h3> 
 
On this page you can set the spread of the interaction vertex according to 
a simple Gaussian distribution. If you instead want a more sophisticated 
parametrization, you can write and link your own 
<code><aloc href="BeamShape">BeamShape</aloc></code> class. 
 
<flag name="Beams:allowVertexSpread" default="off">

If off, then the vertex is set to be the origin.

used to pick <ei>(x, y, z)</ei>.) 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="Beams:sigmaTime" default="0." min="0."> 
The width of a Gaussian distribution of the collision time (in units of 
mm/c). Note that, if the above space parametrization is viewed as the 
effect of two incoming beams along the <ei>+-z</ei> axis, with each beam 
having a Gaussian spread, then the spread of the time would also become 
a Gaussian with the same width as the <ei>z</ei> one (times the 
velocity of the beams, which we expect is close to unity). For flexibility 
we have not enforced any such relation, however. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="Beams:maxDevTime" default="5." min="0.">

The distributions above are all centered at the origin. It is also 
possible to shift the above distributions to be centered around another 
nominal position. You must have <code>Beams:allowVertexSpread = on</code> 
to use this possibility.
