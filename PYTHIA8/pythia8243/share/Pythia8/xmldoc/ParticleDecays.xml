<h2>Particle Decays</h2> 
 
The <code>ParticleDecays</code> class performs the sequential decays of 
all unstable hadrons produced in the string fragmentation stage, 
i.e. up to and including <ei>b</ei> hadrons and their decay products, 
such as the <ei>tau</ei> lepton. It is not to be used for the decay of 
more massive <aloc href="ResonanceDecays">resonances</aloc>, such as top, 
<ei>Z^0</ei> or SUSY, where decays must be performed already at the 
<code>ProcessLevel</code> of the event generation. 
 
<p/> 
The decay description essentially copies the one present in 
PYTHIA since many years, but with some improvements, e.g. in the decay 
tables and the number of decay models available. Recently a more 
sophisticated handling of <ei>tau</ei> decays has also been introduced. 
Some issues may need further polishing. 
 
<h3>Variables determining whether a particle decays</h3> 
 
Before a particle is actually decayed, a number of checks are made. 
 
<p/> 
(i) Decay modes must have been defined for the particle kind; 
tested by the <code>canDecay()</code> method of <code>Event</code> 
(and <code>ParticleData</code>). 
 
<p/> 
(ii) The main switch for allowing this particle kind to decay must 
be on; tested by the <code>mayDecay()</code> method of <code>Event</code> 
(and <code>ParticleData</code>). By default this is defined as true for 
all particles with <ei>tau0</ei> below 1000 mm, and false for ones above, 
see the <aloc href="ParticleDataScheme">Particle Data Scheme</aloc>. 
This means that <ei>mu^+-</ei>, <ei>pi^+-</ei>, <ei>K^+-</ei>, 
<ei>K^0_L</ei> and  <ei>n/nbar</ei> always remain stable unless decays 
are explicity switched on, e.g. <code>211:mayDecay  = true</code>. 
 
<p/> 
(iii) Particles may be requested to have a nominal proper lifetime 
<ei>tau0</ei> below a threshold. 
 
<flag name="ParticleDecays:limitTau0" default="off"> 
When on, only particles with <ei>tau0 &lt; tau0Max</ei> are decayed. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:tau0Max" default="10." min="0."> 
The above <ei>tau0Max</ei>, expressed in mm/c. 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
(iv) Particles may be requested to have an actual proper lifetime 
<ei>tau</ei> below a threshold. 
 
<flag name="ParticleDecays:limitTau" default="off"> 
When on, only particles with <ei>tau &lt; tauMax</ei> are decayed. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:tauMax" default="10." min="0."> 
The above <ei>tauMax</ei>, expressed in mm/c.<br/> 
In order for this and the subsequent tests to work, a <ei>tau</ei> 
is selected and stored for each particle, whether in the end it 
decays or not. (If each test would use a different temporary 
<ei>tau</ei> it would lead to inconsistencies.) 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
(v) Particles may be requested to decay within a given distance 
of the origin. 
 
<flag name="ParticleDecays:limitRadius" default="off"> 
When on, only particles with a decay within a radius <ei>r &lt; rMax</ei> 
are decayed. There is assumed to be no magnetic field or other 
detector effects. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:rMax" default="10." min="0."> 
The above <ei>rMax</ei>, expressed in mm. 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
(vi) Particles may be requested to decay within a given cylindrical 
volume around the origin. 
 
<flag name="ParticleDecays:limitCylinder" default="off"> 
When on, only particles with a decay within a volume limited by 
<ei>rho = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) &lt; xyMax</ei> and <ei>|z| &lt; zMax</ei> 
are decayed. There is assumed to be no magnetic field or other 
detector effects. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:xyMax" default="10." min="0."> 
The above <ei>xyMax</ei>, expressed in mm. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:zMax" default="10." min="0."> 
The above <ei>zMax</ei>, expressed in mm. 
</parm> 
 
<h3>Mixing</h3> 
 
<flag name="ParticleDecays:mixB" default="on"> 
Allow or not <ei>B^0 - B^0bar</ei> and <ei>B_s^0 - B_s^0bar</ei> mixing.

The mixing parameter <ei>x_d = Delta(m_B^0)/Gamma_B^0</ei> in the 
<ei>B^0 - B^0bar</ei> system. (Default from RPP2006.) 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:xBsMix" default="26.05" min="22.0" max="30.0">

<ei>B_s^0 - B_s^0bar</ei> system. (Delta-m from CDF hep-ex-0609040, 
Gamma from RPP2006.) 
</parm> 
 
<h3>Tau decays</h3> 
 
Decays of <ei>tau</ei> leptons can be performed using helicity 
information from the <ei>tau</ei> production process and with the 
hadronic current of the <ei>tau</ei> decay modelled using form factors 
fit to data. The <ei>tau</ei> decay framework is largely based on the 
corresponding Herwig++ implementation <ref>Gre07</ref>, with some 
input from Tauola <ref>Jad90</ref>. A short summary can be found in 
<ref>Ilt12</ref>, while the complete writeup is in <ref>Ilt14</ref>. 
 
<p/> 
 
The decays of <ei>tau</ei> leptons are categorized 
as <code>correlated</code>, where a <ei>tau</ei> pair is produced from 
a single process, or <code>uncorrelated</code>, where only 
one <ei>tau</ei> is produced. Currently internally 
supported <ei>tau</ei> production mechanisms include correlated decays 
from <ei>gamma</ei>, <ei>Z^0</ei>, <ei>Z'^0</ei>, <ei>gamma^*/Z^0/Z'^0</ei>, 
and Higgs bosons (CP-even, odd, or mixed) and uncorrelated decays 
from <ei>W^+-</ei>, <ei>W'^+-</ei>, <ei>B/D</ei> hadrons, and charged 
Higgs bosons. For all mechanisms except <ei>B/D</ei> hadrons, both the 
full process, e.g. <ei>q qbar &rarr; Z^0 &rarr; tau^+ tau^-</ei>, as 
well as just the decay of the boson with a given initial polarization, 
e.g. 
<ei>Z^0 &rarr; tau^+ tau^-</ei>, can be handled. The axial and vector 
couplings of the <ei>Z'^0</ei> and <ei>W'^0</ei> are set from the 
relevant parameters in <aloc href="NewGaugeBosonProcesses">New Gauge 
Boson Processes</aloc>. Note that the CP of the various Higgs bosons 
can be set with the 
options <code>HiggsX:parity</code>, <code>HiggsX:etaParity</code>, 
and <code>HiggsX:phiParity</code> as described 
in <aloc href="HiggsProcesses">Higgs Processes</aloc> 
where <code>X</code> is either <code>H1</code>, <code>H2</code>, 
or <code>A3</code>. 
 
<p/> 
The <ei>tau</ei> polarization and <ei>tau</ei> decay correlation 
mechanism can be determined either using <code>internal</code> matrix 
elements or <code>external</code> SPINUP information provided in the 
event, e.g. via Les Houches Event Files (LHEF). For internal 
determination any <ei>tau</ei> pair or single <ei>tau</ei> from the 
processes of the previous list can be handeled. For external 
determination of a single uncorrelated <ei>tau</ei>, its polarization 
is set to its SPINUP information. When the SPINUP for the <ei>tau</ei> 
is not valid, e.g. when FSR is applied, the SPINUP for the first copy 
of that <ei>tau</ei> is used instead unless also invalid. For the 
external determination of a correlated <ei>tau</ei> pair the following 
options are available. 
 
<modepick name="TauDecays:externalMode" default="2" min="0" max="2"> 
Choice of the external polarization and correlation mechanism for 
correlated <ei>tau</ei> pairs. 
<option value="0">all correlated pairs are treated as single 
uncorrelated <ei>tau</ei> leptons. Their polarization is still set via 
SPINUP.</option> 
<option value="1">the mother of the <ei>tau</ei> pair is found. If the 
mother is from the list of available internal correlated processes, a 
correlated decay is performed. If the SPINUP for the mother is valid, 
this is used to set the mother polarization, otherwise the mother is 
assumed to be unpolarized.</option> 
<option value="2">nothing is done.</option> 
<note>Note</note>: option <code>1</code> has limited functionality as 
SPINUP is intended primarily for particles with 2 spin states. For 
massive vector bosons SPINUP is interpreted here as the transverse 
polarization and so the diagonal for the vector boson helicity density 
matrix is set as <ei>[(1 - SPINUP)/3, 1/3, (1 + SPINUP)/3]</ei>. 
</modepick> 
 
<p/> 
A default behaviour is defined when the polarization and decay 
mechanism cannot be determined using either the internal or external 
methods. If the <ei>tau</ei> is known to be produced from 
a <ei>W^+-</ei>, <ei>gamma</ei>, or <ei>Z^0</ei>, the <ei>tau</ei> 
or <ei>tau</ei> pair is assumed to be produced from an unpolarized 
boson of this type. If the mediator is unknown but there is a 
correlated <ei>tau</ei> pair, the pair is assumed to be produced from 
an unpolarized photon and a warning is issued. Finally, if 
the <ei>tau</ei> is uncorrelated, an unpolarized and uncorrelated 
decay is performed and a warning is issued. 
 
<p/> 
Both the internal and external determination have advantages and 
disadvantages. For example, if an LHEF <ei>Z^0 &rarr; tau^+ tau^-</ei> 
event is passed with SPINUP provided for both <ei>tau</ei>s but 
without SPINUP for the <ei>Z^0</ei> then 
with <code>TauDecays:externalTau</code> set to <code>0</code> the 
decays of the <ei>tau</ei>s will be uncorrelated. Using <code>1</code> 
instead will result in correlations, assuming an 
unpolarized <ei>Z^0</ei>. If using internal determination, then the 
correlation and polarization will be fully calculated using the 
correct production mechanism for the <ei>Z^0</ei>. Consequently, a 
variety of options on how to determine polarization and correlation 
are available, with a sensible default in place which should catch most 
everything. 
 
<modepick name="TauDecays:mode" default="1" min="0" max="5"> 
Choice of <ei>tau</ei> decay model. 
<option value="0">old decay model, with isotropic decays.</option> 
<option value="1">sophisticated decays where external and then 
internal determination is applied.</option> 
<option value="2">sophisticated decays as above, but now <ei>tau</ei>s 
with a mother <code>TauDecays:tauMother</code> are forced into an 
uncorrelated decay with a polarization set 
by <code>TauDecays:tauPolarization</code>.</option> 
<option value="3">sophisticated decays where all <ei>tau</ei>s, 
regardless of mother, are forced into an uncorrelated decay with a 
polarization set 
by <code>TauDecays:tauPolarization</code>.</option> 
<option value="4">sophisticated decays where only internal 
determination is applied.</option> 
<option value="5">sophisticated decays where only external (SPINUP) 
determination is applied.</option> 
<note>Warning 1</note>: options <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, 
to force a specific <ei>tau</ei> polarization, only affect the decay 
of the <ei>tau</ei>. The angular distribution of the <ei>tau</ei> itself, 
given by its production, is not modified by these options. If you want, e.g., 
a righthanded <ei>W</ei>, or a SUSY decay chain, the kinematics should 
be handled by the corresponding cross section class(es), supplemented by 
the resonance decay one(s). The options here could then still be used 
to ensure the correct polarization at the <ei>tau</ei> decay stage. 
<note>Warning 2</note>: for options <code>1</code> 
through <code>5</code>, if the polarization and correlation mechanism 
for the <ei>tau</ei> cannot be determined (internally or externally) 
then the default behaviour described above is applied. 
</modepick> 
 
<parm name="TauDecays:tauPolarization" default="0" min="-1." max="1."> 
Polarization of the <ei>tau</ei> when mode <code>2</code> or <code>3</code> of 
<code>TauDecays:mode</code> is selected. 
</parm> 
 
<modeopen name="TauDecays:tauMother" default="0" min="0">

</modeopen> 
 
<h3>QED radiation</h3> 
 
So far PYTHIA does not have any generic machinery for handling QED radiation 
in normal particle decays. In order to include this, a program like Photos 
<ref>Bar94, Dav10</ref> could be used as an afterburner. In a few cases, 
however, the existing shower machinery can be used also here: for 
two-body decays to a lepton pair (<ei>l^+ l^-</ei> or <ei>l^+- nu_l</ei>). 
Such decays are mediated by <ei>gamma^*/Z^0/W^+-</ei> exchange, for 
which PYTHIA does have an existing machinery that can be applied, 
including first-order matrix-element corrections for the first (hardest) 
photon emission. 
 
<flag name="ParticleDecays:allowPhotonRadiation" default="off"> 
Allow or not photon radiations in decays to a lepton pair, see above. 
<note>Note:</note> The current default is to have radiation switched off, 
in order to avoid double-counting of emissions if you link to an external 
QED-radiation program, as is the norm in many collaborations. 
</flag> 
 
<h3>Other variables</h3> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:mSafety" default="0.0005" min="0." max="0.01"> 
Minimum mass difference required between the decaying mother mass 
and the sum of the daughter masses, kept as a safety margin to avoid 
numerical problems in the decay generation. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:sigmaSoft" default="0.5" min="0.2" max="2."> 
In semileptonic decays to more than one hadron, such as 
<ei>B &rarr; nu l D pi</ei>, decay products after the first three are 
dampened in momentum by an explicit weight factor 
<ei>exp(-p^2/sigmaSoft^2)</ei>, where <ei>p</ei> is the 
three-momentum in the rest frame of the decaying particle. 
This takes into account that such further particles come from the 
fragmentation of the spectator parton and thus should be soft. 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
When a decay mode is defined in terms of a partonic content, a random 
multiplicity (and a random flavour set) of hadrons is to be picked, 
especially for some charm and bottom decays. This is done according to 
a Poissonian distribution, for <ei>n_p</ei> normal particles and 
<ei>n_q</ei> quarks the average value is chosen as 
<eq> 
  n_p/ 2 + n_q/4 + multIncrease * ln ( mDiff / multRefMass) 
</eq> 
with <ei>mDiff</ei> the difference between the decaying particle mass 
and the sum of the normal-particle masses and the constituent quark masses. 
For gluon systems <ei>multGoffset</ei> offers and optional additional 
term to the multiplicity. The lowest possible multiplicity is 
<ei>n_p + n_q/2</ei> (but at least 2) and the highest possible 10. 
If the picked hadrons have a summed mass above that of the mother a 
new try is made, including a new multiplicity. These constraints 
imply that the actual average multiplicity does not quite agree with 
the formula above. 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:multIncrease" default="4." min="2." max="6."> 
The above <ei>multIncrease</ei> parameter, except for 
<code>meMode = 23</code>. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:multIncreaseWeak" default="2.5" min="1." max="4."> 
The above <ei>multIncrease</ei> parameter, specifically for 
<code>meMode = 23</code>. Here the weak decay implies that only the 
virtual W mass should contribute to the production of new particles, 
rather than the full meson mass. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:multRefMass" default="0.7" min="0.2" max="2.0"> 
The above <ei>multRefMass</ei> parameter.

</parm> 
 
<parm name="ParticleDecays:colRearrange" default="0.5" min="0." max="1.0"> 
When a decay is given as a list of four partons to be turned into 
hadrons (primarily for modes 41 - 80)  it is assumed that they are 
listed in pairs, as a first and a second colour singlet, which could 
give rise to separate sets of hadrons. Here <ei>colRearrange</ei> is 
the probability that this original assignment is not respected, and 
default corresponds to no memory of this original colour topology. 
</parm> 
 
<flag name="ParticleDecays:FSRinDecays" default="on"> 
When a particle decays to <ei>q qbar</ei>, <ei>g g</ei>, <ei>g g g</ei> 
or <ei>gamma g g</ei>, with <code>meMode > 90</code>, allow or not a 
shower to develop from it, before the partonic system is hadronized. 
(The typical example is <ei>Upsilon</ei> decay.) 
</flag> 
 
In addition, some variables defined for string fragmentation and for 
flavour production are used also here. 
 
<h3>Modes for Matrix Element Processing</h3> 
 
Some decays can be treated better than what pure phase space allows, 
by reweighting with appropriate matrix elements. In others a partonic 
content has to be converted to a set of hadrons. The presence of such 
corrections is signaled by a nonvanishing <code>meMode()</code> value 
for a decay mode in the <aloc href="ParticleDataScheme">particle 
data table</aloc>. The list of allowed possibilities almost agrees with the 
PYTHIA 6 ones, but several obsolete choices have been removed, 
a few new introduced, and most have been moved for better consistency. 
Here is the list of currently allowed <code>meMode()</code> codes: 
<ul> 
<li>  0 : pure phase space of produced particles ("default"); 
input of partons is allowed and then the partonic content is 
converted into the minimal number of hadrons (i.e. one per 
parton pair, but at least two particles in total)</li> 
<li>  1 : <ei>omega</ei> and <ei>phi &rarr; pi+ pi- pi0</ei></li> 
<li>  2 : polarization in <ei>V &rarr; PS + PS</ei> (<ei>V</ei> = vector, 
<ei>PS</ei> = pseudoscalar), when <ei>V</ei> is produced by 
<ei>PS &rarr; PS + V</ei> or <ei>PS &rarr; gamma + V</ei></li> 
<li> 11 : Dalitz decay into one particle, in addition to the 
lepton pair (also allowed to specify a quark-antiquark pair that 
should collapse to a single hadron)</li> 
<li> 12 : Dalitz decay into two or more particles in addition 
to the lepton pair</li> 
<li> 13 : double Dalitz decay into two lepton pairs</li> 
<li> 21 : decay to phase space, but weight up <ei>neutrino_tau</ei> spectrum 
in <ei>tau</ei> decay</li> 
<li> 22 : weak decay; if there is a quark spectator system it collapses to 
one hadron; for leptonic/semileptonic decays the <ei>V-A</ei> matrix element 
is used, for hadronic decays simple phase space</li> 
<li> 23 : as 22, but require at least three particles in decay</li> 
<li> 31 : decays of type B &rarr; gamma X, very primitive simulation where 
X is given in terms of its flavour content, the X multiplicity is picked 
according to a geometrical distribution with average number 2, and 
the photon energy spectrum is weighted up relative to pure phase space</li> 
<li> 42 - 50 : turn partons into a random number of hadrons, picked according 
to a Poissonian with average value as described above, but at least 
<code>code</code> - 40 and at most 10, and then distribute then in pure 
phase space; make a new try with another multiplicity if the sum of daughter 
masses exceed the mother one </li> 
<li> 52 - 60 : as 42 - 50, with multiplicity between <code>code</code> - 50 
and 10, but avoid already explicitly listed non-partonic channels</li> 
<li> 62 - 70 : as 42 - 50, but fixed multiplicity <code>code</code> - 60</li> 
<li> 72 - 80 : as 42 - 50, but fixed multiplicity <code>code</code> - 70, 
and avoid already explicitly listed non-partonic channels</li> 
<li> 91 : decay to <ei>q qbar</ei> or <ei>g g</ei>, which should shower 
and hadronize</li> 
<li> 92 : decay onium to <ei>g g g</ei> or <ei>g g gamma</ei> 
(with matrix element), which should shower and hadronize</li> 
<li> 93 : decay of colour singlet to <ei>q qbar</ei> plus another singlet, 
flat in phase space (and arbitrarily ordered), where the <ei>q qbar</ei> 
pair should shower and hadronize</li> 
<li> 94 : same as 93, but weighted with <ei>V-A</ei> weak matrix element 
if the decay chain is of the type <ei>neutrino \rarr; dbar u lepton</ei> 
in that order</li> 
<li> 100 - : reserved for the description of partial widths of 
<aloc href="ResonanceDecays">resonances</aloc></li> 
</ul> 
 
Three special decay product identity codes are defined. 
<ul> 
<li>81: remnant flavour. Used for weak decays of c and b hadrons, where the 
c or b quark decays and the other quarks are considered as a spectator 
remnant in this decay. In practice only used for baryons with multiple 
c and b quarks, which presumably would never be used, but have simple 
(copied) just-in-case decay tables. Assumed to be last decay product.</li> 
<li>82: random flavour, picked by the standard fragmentation flavour 
machinery, used to start a sequence of hadrons, for matrix element 
codes in 41 - 80. Assumed to be first decay product, with -82 as second 
and last. Where multiplicity is free to be picked it is selected as for 
normal quarkonic systems. Currently unused.</li> 
<li>83: as for 82, with matched pair 83, -83 of decay products. The 
difference is that here the pair is supposed to come from a closed gluon 
loop (e.g. <ei>eta_c &rarr; g g</ei>) and so have a somewhat higher average 
multiplicity than the simple string assumed for 82, see the 
<code>ParticleDecays:multGoffset</code> parameter above.</li> 
</ul>
