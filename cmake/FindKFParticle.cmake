# Find module for KFParticle 
# Copied and adapted from FindRooUnfold.cmake by Dario Berzano <dario.berzano@cern.ch>
#
# From your `CMakeLists.txt` use it as simply as:
#
#   find_package(KFParticle)
#
# It expects `-DKFPARTICLE=<prefix>` to be passed as argument, and it falls back
# to the environment variable `KFPARTICLE_ROOT`.
#
# A target is exported if KFParticle is found. The target takes care of defining
# all the library paths, compile flags, and include paths. Usage is very simple:
#
#   if(KFParticle_FOUND)
#     target_link_library(MyAnalysisClass MyDep1 MyDep2 KFParticle::KFParticle)
#   endif()
#
# No additional command is required (no `include_directories()`, etc.) and no
# variable other than `KFParticle_FOUND` is exported.

include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)

if(NOT DEFINED KFPARTICLE)
  set(KFPARTICLE "$ENV{KFPARTICLE_ROOT}")
endif()
