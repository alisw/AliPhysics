This is readme file to run PHOS photon/neutral meson analyses in Run2 by PWGGA/PHOSTasks/PHOS_Run2.

1. create an array which contains PHOS clusters as AliCaloPhoton objects.
arguments are following.
AliAnalysisTaskPHOSObjectCreator* AddTaskPHOSObjectCreator(
    const char* name     = "PHOSObjectCreator",
    const UInt_t trigger = AliVEvent::kINT7|AliVEvent::kPHI7,
    const Bool_t usePHOSTender = kTRUE,
    const Bool_t isMC = kFALSE,
    const Double_t BunchSpace = 25,
    const Double_t distanceBC = 0,
    const TString period = "LHC15n"
    )

please select trigger which you want to analyze.
In most cases, usePHOSTender = kTRUE, because calibration, track matching, evaluation of shower shape are done by AliPHOSTenderSupply.cxx/h.
Otherwize, they are performed by PHOSObjectCreator.

BunchSpace is used for setting TOF cut bit. TOF cut criterion = BunchSpace/2.
distanceBC means distance to the closest bad channel.
period is for non-linearity function in different period in MC.


2. analyze the array created by PHOSObjectCreator for photon/neutral mesons

AliAnalysisTaskPHOSPi0EtaToGammaGamma* AddTaskPHOSPi0EtaToGammaGamma(
    const char* name     = "Pi0EtaToGammaGamma",
    const UInt_t trigger = AliVEvent::kINT7,
    const TString CollisionSystem = "pp",
    const Bool_t isMC = kFALSE,
    const Int_t L1input = -1,
    const Int_t L0input = -1,
    const Bool_t useCoreE = kFALSE,
    const Bool_t useCoreDisp = kFALSE,
    const Double_t NsigmaCPV  = 2.5,
    const Double_t NsigmaDisp = 2.5,
    const Bool_t usePHOSTender = kTRUE,
    const Double_t bs = 25.,//bunch space in ns.
    const Double_t distBC = -1,//minimum distance to bad channel.
    const Int_t pThardbin = -1
    )

please select trigger which you want to analyze.
set collision system for centrality estimation.
L1/L0input should be following
const Int_t L1PHH = 7;
const Int_t L1PHM = 6;
const Int_t L1PHL = 5;
const Int_t L0    = 9;
Note that L1 has higher priority than L0.

useCoreE = kTRUE for PbPb
useCoreE = kFALSE for pp, pPb/Pbp
bs and distBC will go to output list name.
pThardbin is only jet-jet M.C.
