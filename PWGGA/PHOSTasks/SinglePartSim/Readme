Scripts for on-flight simulation of single particles and reconstruction in PHOS


Generator described in GeneratorCustom.C macors

Analysis macros (Tagging.C for example) are called in aliroot_dpgsim.sh
One can call several scans with different PHOSTender settings
Can not be done within one root session as PHOSTender modifies PHOS clusters in AOD


Proper calibration and bad maps for PHOSTender settings can be selected in Tagging.C macro(s)
