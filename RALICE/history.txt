04-jul-1997 NvE First release of the package
11-jul-1997 NvE Class Invmass added to /GENUTILS and directories /PHYSICS
                and /TRACKING created to hold Jet and Track classes resp.
15-aug-1997 NvE Pilot patch *RALICE removed and automatic installation
                now completely performed by pure CMZ commands in the
                INSTALL macro.
12-sep-1997 NvE Signal of central cluster module and position in user
                coordinates for all modules introduced in the Calorimetry
                package.
                Also all "float vec[]" replaced by "float* vec" in the
                Lorbo class for stylistic reasons.
20-sep-1997 NvE Name of member function "getc()" of Calorimeter changed to
                "get_c()" to avoid clash with native C function.
                Also protection added in Calorimeter::group() against cases
                where no modules fired.
23-sep-1997 NvE Macro "install" modified to also enable automatic installation
                of a G++ or ROOT loadable shared library 'ralice.sl'.
24-sep-1997 NvE Class "Calorimeter" optimized by introduction of pointers
                for the Module matrix instead of an indexed array.
26-sep-1997 NvE Directory /ROOT added to hold the universal ROOT dictionaries
                (dict.h and dict.cc) as generated by "rootcint" for all the
                classes of this RALICE package.
                This will allow automatic installation of the RALICE library
                without running "rootcint".
30-sep-1997 NvE 2-body decay added to class Track and invokation of "delete []"
                only performed in case the object exists in the destructors
                of the Calorimeter, Jet and Track classes.
02-oct-1997 NvE Installation for MSVC++ added into macro "install" and several
                "return 0.;" statements added in some "Sample" member functions.
                The latter caused MSVC++ compiler errors.
                Also 'int ..=fabs(int..)' changed to 'int ..=int(fabs(int..))'
                in "Cluster::Add()" to prevent G++ warning.
03-oct-1997 NvE The above code is now ANSI compatible, but MSVC++ 5.0 still
                gives an error when comp. extensions are switched off (flag /Za).
                The reason is probably an incorrect implementation of the ANSI
                type conversion rules in MSVC++. To satisfy MSVC++ for the moment
                the code in in "Cluster::Add()" has been changed to
                'int ..=int(fabs(double(int..)))' so that at least a Microsoft
                compatible RALICE.DLL can be produced. As soon as G++ is able
                to produce Microsoft compatible dll's the support for MSVC++
                will be dropped for ralice.cmz.
                Message to all : USE G++ AS COMPILATION STANDARD !
                Also CMZ standard adopted to include a "$" in the DECK names
                which contain KEEP definitions.
13-oct-1997 NvE Compiler directive for g++ changed in "flogon" and "install"
                to provide warning for each non-ANSI C++ statement.
                Also ROOT libs linked with g++ in "install" in case of
                ROOT loadable shared library creation.
                Unused variables removed in "Calorimeter::add_ring" and
                "Track::decay".
14-oct-1997 NvE Strict ANSI requirements dropped for ROOT loadable lib creation
                to avoid many harmless warnings from rootcint generated code.
                Class "Random" added to /GENUTILS and /ROOT updated accordingly.
14-oct-1997 NvE Class "Random" extended with user definable distribution and
                /ROOT updated accordingly.
19-oct-1997 NvE Class "Random" extended with vector facility for user
                defined dist. and also bug fixed. /ROOT updated accordingly.
27-oct-1997 NvE Class "Random" optimised for user definable distribution and
                /ROOT updated accordingly.
10-dec-1997 NvE Creation of MSVC++ loadable library introduced in "install".
12-dec-1997 NvE Keep and Deck in /ROOT given unique names to enable loading
                of this package together with other packages.
20-jan-1998 NvE New ralicedict produced because of new ROOT 1.03/09 version.
23-mar-1998 NvE Macro "install" modified to support HP-CC.
                Multiple usage of for-loop index names removed to satisfy HP-CC
                compiler (although the original code was ANSI C++).
                Cluster data just reset to 'empty cluster' in case of cluster
                'creation' or 'start' for edge module or no-signal module.
31-mar-1998 NvE Array index bug fixed in class Jet.
03-apr-1998 NvE Jet and Invmass classes optimised by using pointers and
                compiler options /GD and /DWIN32 introduced for msvc++
                in order to optimize for windows DLL's and ensure correct
                pre-processing in RConfig.h for ROOT library creation.
13-apr-1998 NvE ROOTCINT processing implemented in $KUMACS/INSTALL and
                contents of /ROOT updated accordingly.
                Class Vertex added to /TRACKING and classes Track and Jet
                protected against modifying of returned addresses.
14-apr-1998 NvE "rm .def" removed for Unix systems in $KUMACS/INSTALL since
                on Unix no .def file is created by ROOTCINT.
17-apr-1998 NvE Return type Track& changed to Track* in the get_trk()
                member functions of the Jet and Vertex classes.
21-apr-1998 NvE Classes Track, Vertex, Jet, Lorbo and Invmass derived from
                TObject to enable ROOT I/O.
                $KUMACS/FLOGON and $KUMACS/INSTALL updated accordingly.

                to enable ROOT I/O.
                Functionality of class Calorimeter has also been extended to
                enable re-clustering of original Module signals.
28-apr-1998 NvE Decay produced Tracks in class Track stored also into TObjArray
                to allow direct I/O.
03-jun-1998 NvE MSVC++ compiler option /DWIN32 removed in $KUMACS/INSTALL
                because of bug fix in ROOT version 2.00.
                Printout of version number introduced in $KUMACS/FLOGON and
                DOC section updated for new email and www address.
17-aug-1998 NvE New ALICE coding conventions adopted and automatic marking
                of 'edge modules' introduced in class AliCalorimeter.
                The automatic treatment of edge modules required new member-
                functions EdgeUp() and EdgeDown() in class AliModule.
19-aug-1998 NvE Call to LoadMatrix() added in AliCalorimeter::Group()
                to correctly treat different event sizes (i.e. empty events)
                when reading data from input file(s).
25-aug-1998 NvE AliCalorimeter::GetModule() introduced to provide quick
                access to all 'fired' modules.
27-aug-1998 NvE GetSignal() and GetClusteredSignal() of AliModule now
                return 0 in case the module was marked as dead.
                Because of the above, protection against row=col=0
                introduced in AliCalorimeter::Group().
                To enable access of modified calorimeter module data via
                AliCalorimeter::GetModule() after reading in, the "fModules"
                elements are updated in AliCalorimeter::LoadMatrix().
16-sep-1998 NvE Correct deletion of the module matrix introduced in the
                AliCalorimeter destructor and AliCalorimeter::LoadMatrix().
16-oct-1998 NvE New ALICE coding conventions adopted. This resulted in
                modifications in /$KUMACS and /ROOT (.cxx extension instead of .cc)
                and /HEADERS (public class area in front of private).
                #include <iostream.h> added in AliCluster (thanks to A.Zvyagin).

                Also AliRandom derived from TObject to enable ROOT I/O.
26-oct-1998 NvE DrawModules() and DrawClusters() histogram axes defined such
                that the X and Y axis corresponds to columns and rows resp.
                in AliCalorimeter. This view matches the 'common sense'.
06-nov-1998 NvE SetDirectory(0) invoked for the histos created in
                DrawModules() and DrawClusters() to suppress global character
                of the histo pointer.
16-nov-1998 NvE New class AliMath implemented in /GENUTILS and /ROOT
                updated accordingly.

                to contain veto signal information.
25-jan-1999 NvE Most of the private areas modified into protected areas to enable
                the use of inheritance.
                Also support for veto signal information introduced in AliCluster.
04-feb-1999 NvE Cluster array for internal use removed in AliCalorimeter; now only
                the "TObjArray* fClusters" is used for performance optimalisation.
06-feb-1999 NvE New class AliPosition implemented for universal position handling
                and AliSignal, AliCluster and AliVertex all derived from AliPosition.
                AliModule inherits from AliSignal and arguments of SetPosition()
                and GetPosition() in AliCalorimeter updated to match the AliSignal
                inheritance of AliModule. 
11-mar-1999 NvE All types changed to Int_t, Float_t etc... in order to guarantee
                portability of all data within the ROOT framework.
12-mar-1999 NvE Default destructors added in AliInvmass, AliLorbo and AliSample.
30-mar-1999 NvE New base class Ali3Vector introduced for universal 3D vector handling
                and AliPosition derived from it.
                In AliSignal::Reset() memberfunction call introduced instead of setting
                datamembers; this enhances flexibility for base class development.
01-apr-1999 NvE "car" introduced as default frame for Ali3Vector::Print().
03-apr-1999 NvE New base class Ali4Vector introduced for universal handling of
                Lorentz 4-vectors.
                Also class AliBoost introduced to perform Lorentz boosts on Ali4Vector
                objects. This class will replace the old AliLorbo.
                Memberfunction Print() renamed to Info() for Ali3Vector, Ali4Vector
                and AliBoost to prevent clash with TObject::Print().

27-apr-1999 NvE AliModule and AliCluster classes renamed to AliCalmodule and AliCalcluster resp.
                in view of future general Aliroot base classes AliModule and AliCluster.
28-jun-1999 NvE Ali4Vector casting changed in AliVertex::Add() and some explicit type conversions
                added and an unused variable removed in AliInvmass to prevent g++ errors/warnings
                (thanks to Eugene van der Pijll).
23-sep-1999 NvE Errors and error propagation introduced in Ali3Vector in view of track
                reconstruction/extrapolation development.
                Also AliPosition and AliSignal updated accordingly by introducing the
                SetPositionErrors(), SetSignalErrors() and Get memberfunctions.
                Note : Errors (propagation) not yet fully implemented in Ali4Vector and
                       AliBoost. 
24-sep-1999 NvE In Ali4Vector internally the Lorentz invariant (x^mu x_mu) is now stored
                instead of the scalar part x^0. This will yield better precision and
                e.g. automatically conserves the particle identity (mass) in elastic
                collisions. 
08-oct-1999 NvE GetResultError() introduced in Ali3Vector to provide error information
                on results obtained from operations which yield a scalar.
                Examples are the error on the norm (GetNorm) and the dotproduct (Dot).
13-oct-1999 NvE Errors and error propagation fully implemented in Ali4Vector.
15-oct-1999 NvE Algorithms for error calculations optimised for accuracy in Ali3Vector
                and Ali4Vector.
                Also particle mass datamember removed from AliTrack, since this is now
                automatically handled via the SetInvariant()/GetInvariant() memberfunctions
                of Ali4Vector.
16-oct-1999 NvE Storage of multiple signal values (with errors) implemented in AliSignal
                and AliCalmodule updated accordingly.
                All documentation moved from the .h files into the .cxx files and also
                Copyright and cvs logs introduced.
                Html documentation generated for all classes using the ROOT automatic
                documentation generator facility.
18-oct-1999 NvE Classes Ali3VectorObj, Ali4VectorObj and AliPositionObj introduced.
20-oct-1999 NvE AliTrack::AddSignal() & co. added to enable relating AliSignals to a certain
                AliTrack object in view of track reconstruction development.
                Also memberfunction Info() added to AliSignal.
24-oct-1999 NvE Full error propagation implemented in AliBoost and obsolete memberfunction
                AliBoost::SetGamma() removed.
25-oct-1999 NvE Undefined "dtheta2" fixed in Ali3Vector::GetErrors() thanks to Rene Brun.
29-oct-1999 NvE Compress() invoked for TObjArray fModules after removal of a single module
                in AliCalorimeter::Reset().
                Begin- and endpoint introduced for AliTrack.
30-oct-1999 NvE Pointer handling introduced instead of object copying in AliCalorimeter::Sortm
                to enhance speed. Also AliCalorimeter::GetModule(row,col) introduced.
                Array creation moved out of default constructor of AliSignal to comply with
                ROOT I/O requirements.
31-oct-1999 NvE AliCalmodule::GetSignal() removed; the AliSignal memberfunction is used
                instead and AliCalorimeter::GetSignal() takes care of the dead modules. 
                AliCalcluster::Start updated accordingly.
                New memberfunctions GetVetoLevel() and HasVetoHit() introduced 
                for AliCalcluster. 
18-jan-2000 NvE AliCalorimeter updated to remove memory leak and to enable event mixing.
                Module and position pointers and various attributes (like edge values etc...)
                are now saved in separate matrices for the complete calorimeter. 
                AliCalmodule and AliCalcluster updated accordingly and also cleaned up
                a little to remove unneeded datamembers. 
03-mar-2000 NvE AliCalorimeter::SetSignal() updated to provide position for new modules
                and AliCalorimeter::AddSignal() updated to invoke AliCalorimeter::SetSignal()
                in case of new modules instead of having duplicate code.
                (Thanks to Eugene van der Pijll).
12-mar-2000 NvE Computation of Integer Order Modified Bessel functions I_n(x) and K_n(x)
                introduced in class AliMath.
                Also already existing AliMath facilities converted to Double_t handling
                to enhance flexibility.
06-jun-2000 NvE AliMath::K() etc... renamed to AliMath::BesselK() etc... for clarity.
07-jun-2000 NvE Vertex linking of AliVertex::Add(AliVertex&) made more sophisticated
                by introduction of automatic generation of connecting track.
