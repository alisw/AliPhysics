04-jul-1997 NvE First release of the package
11-jul-1997 NvE Class Invmass added to /GENUTILS and directories /PHYSICS
                and /TRACKING created to hold Jet and Track classes resp.
15-aug-1997 NvE Pilot patch *RALICE removed and automatic installation
                now completely performed by pure CMZ commands in the
                INSTALL macro.
12-sep-1997 NvE Signal of central cluster module and position in user
                coordinates for all modules introduced in the Calorimetry
                package.
                Also all "float vec[]" replaced by "float* vec" in the
                Lorbo class for stylistic reasons.
20-sep-1997 NvE Name of member function "getc()" of Calorimeter changed to
                "get_c()" to avoid clash with native C function.
                Also protection added in Calorimeter::group() against cases
                where no modules fired.
23-sep-1997 NvE Macro "install" modified to also enable automatic installation
                of a G++ or ROOT loadable shared library 'ralice.sl'.
24-sep-1997 NvE Class "Calorimeter" optimized by introduction of pointers
                for the Module matrix instead of an indexed array.
26-sep-1997 NvE Directory /ROOT added to hold the universal ROOT dictionaries
                (dict.h and dict.cc) as generated by "rootcint" for all the
                classes of this RALICE package.
                This will allow automatic installation of the RALICE library
                without running "rootcint".
30-sep-1997 NvE 2-body decay added to class Track and invokation of "delete []"
                only performed in case the object exists in the destructors
                of the Calorimeter, Jet and Track classes.
02-oct-1997 NvE Installation for MSVC++ added into macro "install" and several
                "return 0.;" statements added in some "Sample" member functions.
                The latter caused MSVC++ compiler errors.
                Also 'int ..=fabs(int..)' changed to 'int ..=int(fabs(int..))'
                in "Cluster::Add()" to prevent G++ warning.
03-oct-1997 NvE The above code is now ANSI compatible, but MSVC++ 5.0 still
                gives an error when comp. extensions are switched off (flag /Za).
                The reason is probably an incorrect implementation of the ANSI
                type conversion rules in MSVC++. To satisfy MSVC++ for the moment
                the code in in "Cluster::Add()" has been changed to
                'int ..=int(fabs(double(int..)))' so that at least a Microsoft
                compatible RALICE.DLL can be produced. As soon as G++ is able
                to produce Microsoft compatible dll's the support for MSVC++
                will be dropped for ralice.cmz.
                Message to all : USE G++ AS COMPILATION STANDARD !
                Also CMZ standard adopted to include a "$" in the DECK names
                which contain KEEP definitions.
13-oct-1997 NvE Compiler directive for g++ changed in "flogon" and "install"
                to provide warning for each non-ANSI C++ statement.
                Also ROOT libs linked with g++ in "install" in case of
                ROOT loadable shared library creation.
                Unused variables removed in "Calorimeter::add_ring" and
                "Track::decay".
14-oct-1997 NvE Strict ANSI requirements dropped for ROOT loadable lib creation
                to avoid many harmless warnings from rootcint generated code.
                Class "Random" added to /GENUTILS and /ROOT updated accordingly.
14-oct-1997 NvE Class "Random" extended with user definable distribution and
                /ROOT updated accordingly.

                /ROOT updated accordingly.
10-dec-1997 NvE Creation of MSVC++ loadable library introduced in "install".
12-dec-1997 NvE Keep and Deck in /ROOT given unique names to enable loading
                of this package together with other packages.
20-jan-1998 NvE New ralicedict produced because of new ROOT 1.03/09 version.
23-mar-1998 NvE Macro "install" modified to support HP-CC.
                Multiple usage of for-loop index names removed to satisfy HP-CC
                compiler (although the original code was ANSI C++).
                Cluster data just reset to 'empty cluster' in case of cluster
                'creation' or 'start' for edge module or no-signal module.
31-mar-1998 NvE Array index bug fixed in class Jet.
03-apr-1998 NvE Jet and Invmass classes optimised by using pointers and
                compiler options /GD and /DWIN32 introduced for msvc++
                in order to optimize for windows DLL's and ensure correct
                pre-processing in RConfig.h for ROOT library creation.
13-apr-1998 NvE ROOTCINT processing implemented in $KUMACS/INSTALL and
                contents of /ROOT updated accordingly.
                Class Vertex added to /TRACKING and classes Track and Jet
                protected against modifying of returned addresses.
14-apr-1998 NvE "rm .def" removed for Unix systems in $KUMACS/INSTALL since
                on Unix no .def file is created by ROOTCINT.
17-apr-1998 NvE Return type Track& changed to Track* in the get_trk()
                member functions of the Jet and Vertex classes.
21-apr-1998 NvE Classes Track, Vertex, Jet, Lorbo and Invmass derived from

                Functionality of class Calorimeter has also been extended to
                enable re-clustering of original Module signals.
28-apr-1998 NvE Decay produced Tracks in class Track stored also into TObjArray
                to allow direct I/O.
03-jun-1998 NvE MSVC++ compiler option /DWIN32 removed in $KUMACS/INSTALL
                because of bug fix in ROOT version 2.00.
                Printout of version number introduced in $KUMACS/FLOGON and
                DOC section updated for new email and www address.

                of 'edge modules' introduced in class AliCalorimeter.
                The automatic treatment of edge modules required new member-
                functions EdgeUp() and EdgeDown() in class AliModule.
19-aug-1998 NvE Call to LoadMatrix() added in AliCalorimeter::Group()
                to correctly treat different event sizes (i.e. empty events)
                when reading data from input file(s).
25-aug-1998 NvE AliCalorimeter::GetModule() introduced to provide quick
                access to all 'fired' modules.
27-aug-1998 NvE GetSignal() and GetClusteredSignal() of AliModule now
                return 0 in case the module was marked as dead.
                Because of the above, protection against row=col=0
                introduced in AliCalorimeter::Group().
                To enable access of modified calorimeter module data via
                AliCalorimeter::GetModule() after reading in, the "fModules"
                elements are updated in AliCalorimeter::LoadMatrix().
16-sep-1998 NvE Correct deletion of the module matrix introduced in the
                AliCalorimeter destructor and AliCalorimeter::LoadMatrix().
16-oct-1998 NvE New ALICE coding conventions adopted. This resulted in
                modifications in /$KUMACS and /ROOT (.cxx extension instead of .cc)
                and /HEADERS (public class area in front of private).
                #include <iostream.h> added in AliCluster (thanks to A.Zvyagin).

                that the X and Y axis corresponds to columns and rows resp.
                in AliCalorimeter. This view matches the 'common sense'.
06-nov-1998 NvE SetDirectory(0) invoked for the histos created in
                DrawModules() and DrawClusters() to suppress global character
                of the histo pointer.

30-mar-1999 NvE New base class Ali3Vector introduced for universal 3D vector handling
                and AliPosition derived from it.
                In AliSignal::Reset() memberfunction call introduced instead of setting
                datamembers; this enhances flexibility for base class development.

                reconstruction/extrapolation development.
                Also AliPosition and AliSignal updated accordingly by introducing the
                SetPositionErrors(), SetSignalErrors() and Get memberfunctions.
                Note : Errors (propagation) not yet fully implemented in Ali4Vector and
                       AliBoost. 
24-sep-1999 NvE In Ali4Vector internally the Lorentz invariant (x^mu x_mu) is now stored
                instead of the scalar part x^0. This will yield better precision and
                e.g. automatically conserves the particle identity (mass) in elastic
                collisions. 
08-oct-1999 NvE GetResultError() introduced in Ali3Vector to provide error information
                on results obtained from operations which yield a scalar.
                Examples are the error on the norm (GetNorm) and the dotproduct (Dot).
13-oct-1999 NvE Errors and error propagation fully implemented in Ali4Vector.
15-oct-1999 NvE Algorithms for error calculations optimised for accuracy in Ali3Vector
                and Ali4Vector.
                Also particle mass datamember removed from AliTrack, since this is now
                automatically handled via the SetInvariant()/GetInvariant() memberfunctions
                of Ali4Vector.
16-oct-1999 NvE Storage of multiple signal values (with errors) implemented in AliSignal
                and AliCalmodule updated accordingly.
                All documentation moved from the .h files into the .cxx files and also
                Copyright and cvs logs introduced.
                Html documentation generated for all classes using the ROOT automatic
                documentation generator facility.
18-oct-1999 NvE Classes Ali3VectorObj, Ali4VectorObj and AliPositionObj introduced.
20-oct-1999 NvE AliTrack::AddSignal() & co. added to enable relating AliSignals to a certain
                AliTrack object in view of track reconstruction development.
                Also memberfunction Info() added to AliSignal.

30-oct-1999 NvE Pointer handling introduced instead of object copying in AliCalorimeter::Sortm
                to enhance speed. Also AliCalorimeter::GetModule(row,col) introduced.
                Array creation moved out of default constructor of AliSignal to comply with
                ROOT I/O requirements.
31-oct-1999 NvE AliCalmodule::GetSignal() removed; the AliSignal memberfunction is used
                instead and AliCalorimeter::GetSignal() takes care of the dead modules. 
                AliCalcluster::Start updated accordingly.
                New memberfunctions GetVetoLevel() and HasVetoHit() introduced 
                for AliCalcluster. 
18-jan-2000 NvE AliCalorimeter updated to remove memory leak and to enable event mixing.
                Module and position pointers and various attributes (like edge values etc...)
                are now saved in separate matrices for the complete calorimeter. 
                AliCalmodule and AliCalcluster updated accordingly and also cleaned up
                a little to remove unneeded datamembers. 
03-mar-2000 NvE AliCalorimeter::SetSignal() updated to provide position for new modules
                and AliCalorimeter::AddSignal() updated to invoke AliCalorimeter::SetSignal()
                in case of new modules instead of having duplicate code.
                (Thanks to Eugene van der Pijll).
12-mar-2000 NvE Computation of Integer Order Modified Bessel functions I_n(x) and K_n(x)
                introduced in class AliMath.
                Also already existing AliMath facilities converted to Double_t handling
                to enhance flexibility.
06-jun-2000 NvE AliMath::K() etc... renamed to AliMath::BesselK() etc... for clarity.
07-jun-2000 NvE Vertex linking of AliVertex::Add(AliVertex&) made more sophisticated
                by introduction of automatic generation of connecting track.

                as introduced in ROOT 3.00/05. 
27-may-2001 NvE New class AliEvent introduced and RALICELinkDef.h & co. updated accordingly.
                Also RALICELinkDef.h changed back to old schema evolution (i.e. "+" removed)

                the modification date is updated automatically in the html docs.
09-jun-2001 NvE Script mklibs.bat modified to match its new location in the SCRIPTS
                subdirectory and file RALICEHeaders.h moved back to the RALICE
                directory again to enable universal installation scripts.

                added to AliVertex.
05-jul-2001 NvE Clone() facility used in AddTrack() etc... of AliEvent & co. instead of
                "new" in the case of TrackCopy etc... This in order to enable 'permanent'
                AliTrack etc... storage in AliEvent & co.

29-apr-2002 NvE Memberfunction GetNvalues() and copy constructor introduced in AliSignal.
25-jun-2002 NvE Memberfunction SetOwner() introduced in AliJet, AliVertex and AliEvent to allow
                to set ownership of "added objects" in the case of reading data from a file.
                In this way possible memory leaks can always be prevented.

                veto hits introduced in AliCalorimeter and AliCalcluster.
28-oct-2002 NvE "Riostream.h" introduced to replace the standard C++ includes and 
                static_cast<int> introduced in AliVertex::Draw to prevent a warning
                message for the new gcc compiler version.

                AliCalorimeter to fix a memory leak.
09-jan-2003 NvE Different modes introduced for AliCalorimeter::Reset() to prevent memory
                leaks in reading back AliCalorimeter objects from a data file.
                Also unnecessary "LoadMatrix()" statement removed in AliCalorimeter::Reset().
                Irrelevant cout statement removed from AliEvent constructor.
01-feb-2003 NvE Memberfunction Info() renamed to Data() in various classes in order to
                prevent problems w.r.t. TObject::Info due to probable root/cint bug. 
03-feb-2003 NvE File "gcclib" added to subdirectory "scripts" to provide Ralice installation
                script for Linux machines using gcc.
                Class AliObjMatrix introduced.
08-feb-2003 NvE Class AliSignal modified such that the maximum number of signal slots is
                handled completely dynamically at runtime.
                Memberfunctions SetSignal() and AddSignal() of class AliCalmodule declared
                virtual to enable inheritance.
09-feb-2003 NvE Class AliCalcluster derived from AliSignal to enable automatic signal setting
                for various rings of modules around the cluster center.
10-feb-2003 NvE Class AliSignal modified such that also signals without errors can be stored.
                This may minimise memory occupation and output file size. 
18-feb-2003 NvE Memberfunction ShowCalorimeters() introduced in AliEvent to display an overview of all
                available calorimeter systems.
                Date/time format changed and ShowCalorimeters() invoked in AliEvent::HeaderData().
08-mar-2003 NvE Compiler option /GR introduced for MSVC++ in mklibs.bat to explicitly enable
                the C++ RTTI. This prevents a warning when creating shared libraries
                using the "old streamer method" (i.e. NO "+" behind the class names
                in the Linkdef file).
10-mar-2003 NvE AliPosition datamembers of AliTrack changed into AliPositionObj* to enable
                minimisation of memory occupation and output file size in case a track
                has not all attributes set.
13-mar-2003 NvE Memberfunction SetZero() introduced for Ali3Vector and Ali4Vector.
20-mar-2003 NvE Statement #include "Riostream.h" moved from header file into implementation file
                for all classes and MSVC compiler option /Za replaced by /Ze in order to prevent
                ANSI compliant compiler problems.
15-apr-2003 NvE Waveform histogram introduced in AliSignal.
29-apr-2003 NvE Memberfunction MakeCopy introduced for AliSignal and AliCalmodule.
                This memberfunction enables automatic creation of new objects of the
                correct type depending on the argument type, a feature which may be very useful
                for containers like AliCalorimeter when adding objects in case the
                container owns the objects. This feature allows e.g. AliCalorimeter
                to store either AliCalmodule objects or objects derived from AliCalmodule,
                provided these derived classes also have a proper MakeCopy memberfunction. 
17-jun-2003 NvE All TString objects "s" replaced by "s.Data()" in cout statements to comply
                with MSVC++7.NET compiler and allow mixing with MSVC++6 libraries.
                The classes in which these modifications were made are Ali3Vector, Ali4Vector,
                AliSignal and AliEvent. 
20-jun-2003 NvE Copy constructor introduced for nearly all classes and also all destructors
                explicitly declared virtual.
11-jul-2003 NvE Functionality of AliObjMatrix extended by enabling removal of objects and
                introduction of a linear object array for fast looping over the stored objects.
15-aug-2003 NvE Usage of TMCParticle removed from AliCollider; only Pythia intrinsic functionality
                is used.
01-sep-2003 NvE Explicit initialisation of TObject() introduced in default constructor of AliObjMatrix.
16-sep-2003 NvE Parent track pointer introduced for AliTrack.
                Functionality of AliSignal extended and support for gains and offsets introduced.
                Gain datamember removed from AliCalmodule.
17-sep-2003 NvE Memberfunction AddTrack with second argument "copy" of AliJet moved into the
                "protected" area to avoid confusion among users.
                The user has now only access to the AddTrack memberfunction with only the track
                (pointer) as argument.
23-sep-2003 NvE New classes AliAttrib and AliAttribObj introduced to centralise the handling of
                name, gain, offset, edge and dead value attributes for a certain slot.
                Classes AliSignal and AliCalmodule updated accordingly.
28-sep-2003 NvE Facility for automatic gain etc... correction introduced in AliSignal::GetSignal().
30-sep-2003 NvE New version of AliCalorimeter introduced, making use of AliObjMatrix and AliAttribObj
                and supporting full treatment of module gains, offsets etc...
                Also class AliCalcluster updated to take gain etc... correction into account.
02-oct-2003 NvE Memberfunction Load() moved from Ali3VectorObj and Ali4VectorObj to Ali3Vector
                and Ali4Vector respectively. This allows to use this memberfunction also in
                all the derived classes (e.g. AliPosition, AliSignal, AliTrack, etc...).
                Therefore the Load() memberfunction has been removed from AliPositionObj.
03-oct-2003 NvE Typos fixed in AliCalorimeter.cxx.
                Also memberfunction MakeCopy introduced in class AliCalorimeter.
07-oct-2003 NvE Arguments of SetSignal and AddSignal memberfunctions of AliCalmodule corrected
                to comply with the corresponding virtual functions of AliSignal.
                AliCalorimeter modified accordingly.
09-oct-2003 NvE Argument of all MakeCopy memberfunctions removed to obey the ANSI C++ rules for
                virtual functions and to prepare for a common base class.
                Due to the fact that not all compilers seem to accept the standard ANSI rule
                that a virtual function is allowed to differ in return type from the corresponding
                virtual function in the base class, the MakeCopy() memberfunctions have all been
                given a return type of TObject*.
                Also AliAttrib::Data renamed to AliAttrib::List to prevent violation of ANSI virtual
                function rules and class AliSignal updated accordingly. 
                Memberfunction ResetPosition() moved from AliSignal to AliPosition.
                Explicitly declared all memberfunctions virtual in the derived classes in case
                the corresponding memberfunctions were also declared virtual in the base class.
                Various memberfunctions which were declared virtual but were actually not meant
                to be overridden declared as non-virtual in various low-level classes like
                Ali3Vector, Ali4Vector, AliPosition etc...
13-oct-2003 NvE Argument 'npt' of AliCollider::MakeEvent also made optional.
24-oct-2003 NvE Private memberfunction Dump of AliTrack and AliVertex renamed to Dumps in order
                not to override the Dump memberfunction of TObject.
                Also definition of AliVertex::Draw slightly modified to comply with the standard
                ANSI virtual function rules concerning TObject::Draw.
                Invokation of ClassName() used in printout of AliSignal::Data to make the output
                information more generic. 
25-oct-2003 NvE Memberfunction AddCalorimeter of AliEvent replaced by memberfunction AddDevice
                to make the functionality more generic.
                To comply with the enhanced flexibility of AliEvent::AddDevice the class
                AliCalorimeter has been derived from TNamed and the MakeCopy() memberfunction
                has been replaced by Clone() to override the default one of TNamed.
                The specific GetName and SetName memberfunctions of AliCalorimeter have been removed.
26-oct-2003 NvE Class AliSignal derived from TNamed and MakeCopy() memberfunction replaced by Clone()
                like was done for AliCalorimeter.
                The latter was also done for AliCalmodule and AliAttribObj.
29-oct-2003 NvE Obsolete include of AliCalorimeter.h removed from AliEvent header file.
11-nov-2003 NvE Double_t dum=GetScalar() replaced by e[0]=GetScalar() in Ali4Vector.cxx to prevent
                a warning for the gcc compiler (thanks to Thomas Burgess).
                AliJet derived from TNamed instead of TObject to allow identification via name.
12-nov-2003 NvE fDaytime datamember of AliEvent changed from TDatime to TTimeStamp in order to
                obtain nanosecond precision. Setting of date and time via a TDatime argument is
                still supported to provide backward compatibility.
13-nov-2003 NvE Invokation of AliAttrib memberfunction Data() replaced by List() in the example
                in AliAttrib.cxx (was just a typo; thanks Adam Bouchta).
                Also test on pointer value introduced in AliAttrib::GetSlotIndex to prevent
                crash when first slot is empty (thanks to Adam Bouchta).
21-nov-2003 NvE Variable names of type "const" started with the character "k" in various
                memberfunctions of AliMath in order to comply with the strict Alice
                coding conventions.
22-nov-2003 NvE Support for various computation modes introduced in AliMath::Prob.
23-nov-2003 NvE New memberfunctions GetBetaVector(), GetBeta() and GetGamma() introduced in Ali4Vector.
03-dec-2003 NvE Message removed from AliEvent::GetDevice in case there are no devices present.
05-dec-2003 NvE Memberfunction SetStable introduced in AliCollider for the user's convenience.
08-dec-2003 NvE AliTrack derived from TNamed to enhance labeling flexibility and also specific
                Clone memberfunction introduced to enable storage of derived objects in AliJet & co.
                Also specific Clone memberfunctions introduced for AliJet, AliVertex and AliEvent and
                for the already existing specific Clone memberfunctions the default argument was set
                to the empty string "".
15-dec-2003 NvE Datamembers fNdec and fNsig removed from AliTrack since these data are now retrieved
                directly from the corresponding arrays.
                Support for hypothesis probability introduced in AliTrack and old mass hypothesis
                machinery extended to provide now full track hypotheses.
18-dec-2003 NvE Support for object references from the various signal slots introduced in AliSignal.
                Since this is mainly intended for "backward references" to AliTrack objects,
                the AliTrack class has been slightly updated for this to provide pointer consistency
                in case the corresponding AliTrack object is deleted.
19-dec-2003 NvE Slight modification in AliVertex.h and AliAttribObj.cxx to prevent gcc compiler
                warning concerning an unused variable.
22-dec-2003 NvE Event selection introduced in AliCollider.
24-dec-2003 NvE Some cosmetics in printout of AliVertex, AliEvent and AliCollider.
                Support for spectator tracks introduced in AliCollider.
28-dec-2003 NvE Facility introduced in AliCollider to set minimal momentum for spectator tracks
                to be stored. 
06-feb-2004 NvE "char* name" changed to "const char* name" in all specific Clone memberfunctions
                to prevent compiler warnings on Sun.
                Memberfunction Set() of TTimeStamp used in AliEvent instead of setting the date/time
                via the TTimeStamp constructor. This is only possible with ROOT version 3.10/02 or later,
                since for earlier versions the TTimeStamp::Set memberfunctions were erroneously declared
                private. 
11-feb-2004 NvE In script "gcclib" the option -Wno-long-long added to prevent warnings from the usage
                of type "long long" in Rtypes.h
12-feb-2004 NvE In AliCollider::MakeEvent the statement "char* name" was replaced by "char name[16]" to
                comply with TPythia6 convention. Also the hardcoded values of the p and n masses have
                been replaced by masses obtained from the Pythia system via a call to GetPMAS(). 
                Because of a bug in TPythia6 the function Pymass() couldn't be used directly.
13-feb-2004 NvE AliCollider::GetPyname introduced to provide a correctly stripped character string
                for the particle names. The name returned by TPythia6::Pyname contains trailing
                characters due to an incorrect stripping process.
                AliCollider::MakeEvent was updated accordingly to make use of this new memberfunction.
04-mar-2004 NvE Functionality of AliObjMatrix extended to provide the number of references and
                (row,col) indices of all the occurrences of the stored objects.
                Also an additional memberfunction AliObjMatrix::RemoveObject introduced to allow more
                flexibility in specifying objects to be removed. 
09-mar-2004 NvE Additional memberfunction AliObjMatrix::RemoveObject renamed to RemoveObjects to prevent
                confusion and ambiguity in usage.
                Linking facility of AliSignal extended by enabling multiple links to a specific signal slot.
                Also call to AliSignal::ResetLink changed to AliSignal::ResetLinks() in the dtor
                of AliTrack to adopt the extended AliSignal linking facility and output in 
                AliTrack::ListAll() limited to only the referring signal slots to prevent long output lists.
12-mar-2004 NvE Additional "cout << endl;" in front of AliCollider initialisation message in order to always
                have the initialisation message starting on a new line. On some systems the fortran
                carriage control of the pure Pythia doesn't get treated correctly.
04-apr-2004 NvE SetMass() invoked from AliTrack::Set3Momentum to get also the energy properly initialised.
09-apr-2004 NvE Support for specification of unit scale introduced in AliPosition.
19-apr-2004 NvE Memberfunction GetPrimed introduced for Ali3Vector.
04-may-2004 NvE Various memberfunctions declared "const" to satisfy the strict Alice coding rules
                and also to allow better compiler optimisation.
12-may-2004 NvE Track reference-point introduced in AliTrack.
02-jun-2004 NvE Memberfunction GetUnprimed introduced for Ali3Vector.
17-jun-2004 NvE New class AliHelix introduced and "macgcclib" added to create ralice libs on MAC.
24-jun-2004 NvE Coefficient kp7 changed from 7.4e-5 to 7.4e-6 in AliMath::BesselK0 to correct typo
                (thanks Josh de Bever).
                Typos corrected (i.e. abs() replaced by fabs() in several places) in AliHelix
                to satisfy the Intel compiler (thanks Fons Rademakers).
25-jun-2004 NvE Protection introduced in AliSignal::GetNlinks.
29-jun-2004 NvE New class AliDevice introduced.
                New memberfunctions and datamembers introduced in AliEvent to support investigation
                and ordering of hits of various (classes of) devices.
01-jul-2004 NvE AliCalorimeter derived from AliDevice to extend functionality (e.g. allow definition
                of sets of calorimeters and investigate all the hits of a certain set via the
                AliEvent structure). To prevent matrix swapping restrictions, the memberfuctions
                SetSwapMode and GetSwapMode of AliCalorimeter have been renamed to SetMatrixSwapMode
                and GetMatrixSwapMode, respectively. 
                Examples in the AliEvent.cxx documentation updated accordingly. 
                Backward links reset for non-owned hits in AliDevice destructor.
06-jul-2004 NvE AliCalorimeter hit I/O only via the linear array to decrease filesize on disk
                and improve I/O speed.
                Internal temp. arrays used for hit sorting in AliDevice and AliEvent and array
                pointers returned instead of the arrays themselves. This will provide more
                flexibility in usage. 
                Sorting and clustering procedures in AliCalorimeter modified to use TObjArray pointers
                to enable direct use of the AliDevice linear sorting facility.
                Default for AliDevice changed such that now all registered hits are by default owned
                by the AliDevice object.
06-oct-2004 NvE Full support for data access via slotname specification introduced in AliAttrib and AliSignal.
07-oct-2004 NvE Docs of AliAttrib and AliSignal updated for new data access via slotname specification.
12-oct-2004 NvE Display facility introduced in AliDevice and device backward linking updated for
                new "owning device" in AliSignal.
13-oct-2004 NvE Hit investigation facilities extended in AliDevice and AliEvent.
15-oct-2004 NvE Optimisation of MC parameters for nucleus-nucleus and astrophysics processes introduced
                in AliCollider. Also facilities added to provide full user control.
26-nov-2004 NvE Printout of UniqueID added in AliSignal::Data() and AliEvent::ShowDevices() in view of
                addressing specific signals or devices during data analysis.
                Memberfunction GetIdHit introduced in AliDevice and AliEvent and AliJet::GetIdTrack
                optimised for speed.
                Memberfunction GetIdDevice introduced in AliEvent.
27-nov-2004 NvE Protection for j<1 introduced in AliSignal::SetWaveform().
                The waveforms in AliSignal have now become completely decoupled from signal slots,
                so support for setting waveforms by specifying a slotname has been removed. 
                Printout info in AliSignal::Data() and AliSignal::List() improved and memberfunctions
                ListWaveform() and GetWaveformIndex() introduced in AliSignal.
28-nov-2004 NvE User definable status word introduced in AliDevice to allow indication of different
                versions of readout electronics etc... 
29-nov-2004 NvE Additional sub-directories (e.g. wa98) introduced which contain Ralice implementations
                to serve data analysis efforts for various experiments.
01-dec-2004 NvE Install scripts like e.g. "gcclib" renamed to "gcclib.sh" etc... in /scripts.
                The old scripts (i.e. without the .sh extension) will be deleted in due time.
12-jan-2005 NvE Bug fix in AliAttrib::GetSlotIndex() by exiting as soon as matching name is found.
20-jan-2005 NvE Modification in AliSignal::GetNwaveforms() to return last index instead of array
                size to take into account the fact that a TObjArray always gets a default size
                of 16 when reading data from a file.
                Also the standard ROOT file libNew.lib is now automatically renamed to libNew.lix
                in the Ralice windows installation script mklibs.bat to prevent linking with
                this libNew.lib which is inconsistent with the binary ROOT executable release.
09-feb-2005 NvE New class AliTimestamp introduced to support timestamp information for
                astrophysical research (i.e. Julian dates etc...) without the restrictions
                of class TTimeStamp.
10-feb-2005 NvE AliEvent modified such that it is derived from AliTimestamp.
                This will allow events to be synchronised with astrophysical phenomena without
                the restrictions imposed by TTimeStamp.
                All existing user functions have been kept to provide full backward compatibility
                in usage. However, a side effect of the new structure is that when reading data files
                containing the old event structures, the original date/time stamp information is lost and
                replaced by the date/time at the moment of reading the data.
                This implies that to restore the original event date/time, the data files have to
                be re-created. This I/O backward incompatibility could not be avoided in the
                effort of eliminating the TTimeStamp restrictions.
04-mar-2005 NvE Installation scripts named amdgcclib.sh introduced in all /scripts directories to enable
                shared library creation on AMD 64 (Athlon and Opteron) machines.
31-mar-2005 NvE AliObjMatrix derived from TNamed instead of from TObject to allow specification of
                a name and title for this class.
13-apr-2005 NvE New memberfunctions SetFitDetails and GetFitDetails introduced in AliTrack
                to enable a versatile facility to store details of various fit procedures
                for a certain track. This new facility is based on the original idea of Adam Bouchta.
                Destructor of AliSignal modified to remove the corresponding AliSignal instance
                first from all related tracks before deleting the link matrix area.
14-apr-2005 NvE Functionality of ShowDevices extended in AliEvent. Also memberfunction HeaderData() modified
                to prevent long output lists when many devices (and/or tracks) are present.
                New memberfunction ShowTracks introduced in AliJet and memberfunction Data() updated.
18-apr-2005 NvE New memberfunction GetTracks introduced in AliJet to provide various track selections.
19-apr-2005 NvE Memberfunctions GetNtracks and GetTracks of AliJet extended in functionality.
20-apr-2005 NvE Id of owning device added to the output of AliSignal::Data().
10-may-2005 NvE Support for timestamps introduced in AliTrack and AliPosition.
                Memberfunction GetX introduced in Ali3Vector for easy component access.
                Picosecond support and calculation of time difference introduced in AliTimestamp 
                to enable investigation of both very short (i.e. time of flight analysis in
                particle physics experiments) and very long (i.e. astrophysical phenomena)
                time intervals.
17-may-2005 NvE Functionality of AliTimestamp extended w.r.t. treatment of time intervals and
                accuracy bug fixed in the calculation of time difference.
19-may-2005 NvE AliTimestamp* pointer arguments supported in AliTimestamp::GetDifference for convenience
                when investigating e.g. TOF or trigger times for tracks and/or hits in analysing
                AliEvent structures.
                Also GetMJD() invoked in GetDifference to ensure to always have updated Julian parameters.
22-may-2005 NvE Class AliMath extended to provide full distribution functions of several standard
                distributions (e.g. Binomial, Poisson, Gauss) and key statistics (e.g. Chi-squared,
                Student's T, F-test) in view of analysis using Bayesian logic.
                The various distributions are provided as TF1 objects.
                In addition, functions to provide the P-values of the various key statistics are also
                introduced to allow a classical frequentist analysis as well.
25-may-2005 NvE Declaration of unused variable pi removed in AliMath::StudentDist and explicit double
                specification of integer first argument to pow() in AliMath::FratioPvalue in order
                to prevent messages from the gcc compiler (thanks Dipo, Philippe and Peter).
02-jun-2005 NvE Bug fix in copy ctor of AliPosition and beginpoint etc... setting of AliTrack.
                In AliTrack all points are now set after first deleting the existing AliPositionObj
                object instead of using the Ali3Vector::Load() memberfunction. 
                The bug arose because of the extension of AliPosition with the possibility to
                store an AliTimestamp. This made AliPosition differ from Ali3Vector w.r.t. datamembers.
                Also "cout << endl;" introduced after the Pylist() call in AliCollider in order to
                separate the Pythia event listing from subsequent output due to the mis-interpretation
                of Fortran carriage-control characters on some systems.
17-jun-2005 NvE New class AliJob introduced to provide a flexible (physics) analysis environment.
                Bug (forgotten ps transfer in AliTimestamp::SetTJD) fixed (thanks Federico Carminati).
22-jun-2005 NvE Specific job folder recursively removed from the generic AliJob folder environment
                in the AliJob destructor before actually deleting the specific job folder itself. 
                Also main object pointer updated in case of a match with removal of object(s) from
                the specific job environment.
23-jun-2005 NvE Creation of specific job folder made optionally in AliJob.
24-jun-2005 NvE Selection/overruling of specific job folder creation introduced in AliJob::ExecuteJob
                and the AliJob (derived) instance explicitly removed from the ListOfTasks to prevent
                ROOT crashing when closing after execution.
02-aug-2005 NvE Support for explicit (de)calibration functions introduced in AliAttrib.
03-aug-2005 NvE AliSignal::GetSignal has been extended to support various (de)calibration facilities.
                Printout is now also provided in AliSignal::List when only calibration data exist
                for AliDevice (or derived) objects.
05-aug-2005 NvE Typos fixed in AliAttrib::GetCalFunction and AliAttrib::GetDecalFunction which
                erroneously always returned a null pointer.
10-aug-2005 NvE AliSignal::GetSignal extended with mode=8 to support dead flag of parent device
                in conjunction with the dead flag of the signal itself.
07-oct-2005 NvE Support for the extended AliSignal::GetSignal (de)calibration facilities
                introduced in memberfunctions SortHits, GetExtremes, Displayhits and SortDevices
                of classes AliDevice and AliEvent.
                Note : For DisplayHits this new signal correction mode replaces the marker style
                       specification parameter. 
                Also new memberfunction GetDevices introduced in AliEvent.
11-oct-2005 NvE SetMJD invoked at the end of AliTimestamp::Add instead of just updating the
                various datamembers. In this way the TTimeStamp parameters are brought in sync
                with the (modified) AliTimestamp values. 
20-oct-2005 NvE Directory /macros introduced and ROOT macro makedocs.cc added in /macros
                to provide a generic method to auto-create the html class documentation
                on all supported platforms.
                For further details see /macros/makedocs.cc.
24-oct-2005 NvE Protection introduced in AliJet::AddTrack to prevent multiple storage of
                the same track in case no private copy of the track is made.
                Memberfunction GetOpeningAngle introduced in Ali3Vector and Ali4Vector.
25-oct-2005 NvE Support introduced for user selectable angular units (rad or deg) in Ali3Vector,
                Ali4Vector and all derived classes.
27-oct-2005 NvE Memberfunction GetX to access individual vector components also introduced
                for Ali4Vector.
                Also memberfunction SortJets introduced in AliVertex.
                Misleading comment modified in AliDevice.cxx.
29-oct-2005 NvE Forgotten angular unit setting fixed w.r.t. begin point etc... in AliTrack::ListAll
                ad begin point etc... info also added in AliTrack::List.
                Memberfunction SortTracks introduced in AliJet and comment corrected in AliVertex.h.
07-nov-2005 NvE Macro makedocs.cc in directory /macros modified (i.e. ";" changed by ":") to make
                it generic so that it works correctly on all platforms (thanks Axel Naumann). 
08-nov-2005 NvE Sorting memberfunctions in AliDevice, AliVertex and AliJet optimised to save
                CPU time. In case two values are identical no swap is performed.
                Basically the test "val1 < val2" was replaced by "val1 <= val2".
09-nov-2005 NvE DisplayHits memberfunctions in AliDevice updated to fully support all 
                (de)calibration modes of GetSignal for displaying (and skipping dead) hits.
14-nov-2005 NvE Hit access by name introduced in AliDevice.
15-nov-2005 NvE Support for opening angle calculation between a 3-vector and the 3-vector part
                of a 4-vector introduced in Ali4Vector.
16-nov-2005 NvE Support for a reference point introduced in AliJet.
06-dec-2005 NvE Memberfunction GetDistance() introduced in AliTrack to determine the
                distance between a track and a certain position.
12-dec-2005 NvE Track selection by name introduced in AliJet.
23-feb-2006 NvE Support for automatic subtask(s) execution introduced in AliJob::ExecuteJob().
28-feb-2006 NvE Memberfunction ProcessObject() introduced in AliJob for convenience.
14-mar-2006 NvE RemoveTracks() facilities introduced in AliJet.
17-mar-2006 NvE Support for marker of track starting point introduced in AliHelix.
                This allows observation of moving direction in event displays.
                Also support for ignoring track endpoints introduced in AliHelix to 
                allow correct display for very long tracks together with observed hits.
18-mar-2006 NvE Support for display of selected track array introduced in AliHelix.
                Also copy ctor of AliHelix made complete for new datamembers.
22-mar-2006 NvE Line attribute selections for displays extended in AliHelix.
20-apr-2006 NvE Several small modifications to prevent gcc warnings.
10-may-2006 NvE Distance determination between tracks and/or jets introduced in
                AliTrack and AliJet.
                Also compiler warnings activated for overloaded virtuals in installation
                script for AMD Athlon in the /scripts sub-directory.
22-jun-2006 NvE Linear track storage facility introduced in AliSignal to enable
                a lightweight signal <-> track backward linking facility instead of
                the elaborate signal slot related links. 
                Also the functionality of AliTrack::AddSignal extended with specific modes.
                Double_t replaced by Double32_t in Ali3Vector.h, Ali4Vector.h and AliBoost.h
                and fDresult suppressed for I/O streaming. This will reduce the produced
                output filesize.
21-jul-2006 NvE AliSample extended for computation of median.
12-sep-2006 NvE Memberfunctions GetNslots and AddNamedSlot introduced and various
                modifications made in AliAttrib and AliSignal to overcome a ROOT
                feature which always sets the size of TArray objects to a default
                of 16 when reading these objects back from a file.
                The modified AliAttrib and AliSignal don't rely on a GetSize()
                anymore, but determine the number of stored values from the
                actual array contents. 
19-sep-2006 NvE Accuracy problem solved in Ali3Vector::GetOpeningAngle.
20-sep-2006 NvE AliSample::GetMedian corrected for empty or single value arrays.
