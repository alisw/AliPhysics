//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
21-apr-2005 NvE First release of the package as a subdirectory of Ralice/icepack.
29-apr-2005 NvE Library creation scripts for Linux gcc etc... introduced.
                Argument 'float' changed to 'double' for function isnan in amanda.c
                to match gcc definition and setting of unused variable 'pi' removed
                from IceF2k.cxx.
17-jun-2005 NvE Class IceF2k modified to provide a task-based processing environment.
                For this IceF2k has been derived from the new RALICE class AliJob.
                The example macro icef2k.cc has been updated accordingly.
21-jun-2005 NvE Install scripts for gcc corrected to also include the rdmc stuff
                in the produced shared libs.
23-jun-2005 NvE Specification of output file and consequently writing-out of the
                produced datastructures made optionally in IceF2k.
                This will allow IceF2k to be used as a facility to investigate/analyse
                F2K data using the Ralice/IcePack analysis tools without producing output
                data files.
24-jun-2005 NvE In the IceF2k docs and the icef2k.cc example macro the output file is
                not explicitly closed to allow interactive investigation of the output
                data tree when the macro is run in an interactive ROOT/CINT session.
20-jul-2005 NvE RDMC index "off by one" problem fixed in IceF2k.cxx when setting the
                bin contents for a waveform histogram.
05-aug-2005 NvE Support for printfreq=0 introduced in IceF2k to allow suppression of
                the event summary printout.
08-aug-2005 NvE (De)calibration functions introduced in IceF2k::FillOMdbase and IceF2k::PutHits
                to enable access to either automatically calibrated or de-calibrated data.
11-aug-2005 NvE New class IceCal2Root introduced to convert Amacalib ascii data into
                Ralice/IcePack structures.
20-sep-2005 NvE Dummy values 0 set for KAPPA-ADC and KAPPA-TOT for OMs in IceCal2Root
                to stay in line with the F2K data structures.
                Also ADC dependent LE (de)calibration parameter set to 1e20 in IceF2k
                for adc<=0 values. This setting eliminates the ADC dependent TDC correction.
12-oct-2005 NvE CleanTasks() invoked before execution of sub-tasks in IceConvert and IceCal2Root
                to ensure proper execution of all the sub-tasks for each new event.
31-oct-2005 NvE Some unused variables removed in IceCal2Root and IceF2k to prevent warnings
                from the gcc compiler.
09-nov-2005 NvE Additional memberfunctions SetOutputFile(TString name) and GetOutputFile added
                to IceF2k to provide a more user friendly running environment.
                The example in the IceF2k docs has been updated accordingly.
13-nov-2005 NvE IceF2k updated to store also the event trigger information in the Ralice/Icepack
                event structures. The information is stored in the IceEvent structure in the
                form of a device named "Trigger". The various event triggers encountered in the
                F2K input data are stored as "hits" into this trigger device.
15-feb-2006 NvE Name of reconstructed tracks set to "Sieglinde" in IceF2k.
                This is in line with the names "IceDwalk", "IcePandel" etc... and allows
                easy retrieval of specific reconstruction results.
28-feb-2006 NvE Memberfunction AddInputFile introduced in IceF2k to allow processing of
                multiple F2K input files.
                The example in the IceF2k docs and in the /macros sub-directory has been
                updated accordingly.
07-mar-2006 NvE Time offset correction introduced in IceF2k::PutHits() to account for
                possible re-definition of hit times in the Sieglinde filtering process.
                (Thanks David Boersma).
08-mar-2006 NvE Time offset correction in IceF2k extended to allow also a user defined offset
                to cope with Monte Carlo data.
22-mar-2006 NvE Support for selective MC track storage introduced in IceF2k.
10-may-2006 NvE Compiler warnings activated for overloaded virtuals in installation
                script for AMD Athlon in the /scripts sub-directory.
13-jun-2006 NvE Correction in IceF2k::PutHits() for correct setting of name ad title
                in case of Noise and Afterpulse hits in MC data.
                (Thanks Michael Walter). 
14-jun-2006 NvE TWR polarity reversed in IceF2k::PutHits() to be compatible with
                the ATWD histograms.
                Also modification made in IceF2k::PutHits() to correctly obtain the ADC values
                for secondary etc... hits in the same OM.
22-jun-2006 NvE Bi-directional links for signals <-> tracks set via the new lightweight
                AliSignal::AddTrack facility instead of AddLink in IceF2k. 
                Also default split level set to 0 in IceF2k to minimise file size and
                I/O time.
13-sep-2006 NvE IceF2k updated for multiple waveforms per OM by making use of the
                new AliAttrib::AddNamedSlot facility.
                Also some calibration constants dropped from OM data words in IceF2k
                and IceCal2Root, since these values are also stored as parameters in
                the corresponding (de)calibration functions.                 
                Also for TWR data the values stored in the histos are (baseline-amp),
                so that all pulses appear as positive instead of negative and the
                resulting histos are baseline corrected.
25-oct-2006 NvE IceF2k updated to include an IceF2k device into the event structure
                containing the processor parameters.
14-dec-2006 NvE IceF2k updated to include a Daq device into the event structure
                containing an indication of the DAQ system that was used to produce
                the hit data (i.e. ADC, LE, TOT).
16-dec-2006 NvE New class IceRawTWR introduced to read raw TWR data into the Ralice/IcePack
                event structures.
11-jan-2007 NvE IceRawTWR.cxx updated to prevent gcc compiler warnings about unused
                variables.
