20-oct-2005 NvE Trigger time window selection introduced in IceCleanHits based
                on Dipo's trigger time distributions. For further details see the
                docs of IceCleanHits.
31-oct-2005 NvE Slight correction in IceCalibrate.cxx and IceCleanhits.cxx to satisfy
                the gcc compiler (thanks Dipo).
                Also first (prototype) version of class IceDwalk introduced to perform
                direct walk reconstruction. In the /macros directory an example job
                icedwalk.cc has been introduced.
03-nov-2005 NvE User selectable trigger time setting introduced in IceCleanhits to allow
                investigation of various trigger time settings.
                Protection introduced in IceDwalk for the case that no track candidates
                are left.
                Also protection introduced in IceXtalk for the case that no OM database
                was specified. 
14-nov-2005 NvE Only devices derived from IceGOM taken into account in IceCalibrate
                and only devices derived from IceAOM taken into account in IceXtalk 
                to comply with the presence of the newly introduced Trigger device.

23-feb-2006 NvE All global slotnames and signals copied from OM Dbase info (if present)
                in IceCalibrate. This will provide all necessary calib. info in case
                the original F2K file didn't contain these data.
                Also anaroot.cc example macro introduced in /macros sub-directory.
                This example macro shows how to analyse the IcePack event structures
                from a chain of ROOT files using the task processor facilities.
28-feb-2006 NvE Example macro anaroot.cc in sub-directory /macros updated to use the
                more convenient new ProcessObject() facility of AliJob.
                Also unused variables r, rmin and rmax removed in IcePandel.cxx to prevent
                compiler warnings. 
07-mar-2006 NvE Facility introduced in IceDwalk and IcePandel to modify the name tag of
                the produced tracks via the memberfunction SetTrackName().
                Also specification of maximum number of good fired modules for events to
                be processed introduced in IceDwalk. 
10-mar-2006 NvE Xtalk ADC correction value stored as ADC offset in IceXtalk processing.
                This will allow easy investigation of Xtalk corrected hits and also
                enable successive Xtalk processing to investigate (systematic) effects
                of various criteria. See the IceXtalk docs for further details.
                Also specification of minimum number of good fired modules for events to
                be processed introduced in IceDwalk. 
                New class IceLinefit introduced.  
14-mar-2006 NvE User defined track charge setting introduced in IceDwalk, IceLinefit and IcePandel.
29-mar-2006 NvE Modified numerical evaluation of pandel value in IcePandel to extend validity
                range (by George and Dipo).
                Also new memberfunction SetPenalty() introduced in IcePandel.
21-apr-2006 NvE TFile.h included in header files of IceCalibrate and IceXtalk to prevent
                compiler error with new ROOT 5.11 version.
10-may-2006 NvE Compiler warnings activated for overloaded virtuals in installation
                script for AMD Athlon in the /scripts sub-directory.
23-jun-2006 NvE New lightweight AliSignal::AddTrack facility used in IceLinefit and IceDwalk.
07-jul-2006 NvE Track Id correctly set in IceLinefit.
28-jul-2006 NvE New class IceChi2 introduced and example macro icechi2.cc added.
                Also IcePandel updated to use a Convoluted Pandel pdf.
14-sep-2006 NvE IceCalibrate.cxx updated to correctly process multiple waveforms and hits per OM.
                Also some calibration constants dropped from OM data words in IceCalibrate,
                since these values are also stored as parameters in the corresponding
                (de)calibration functions.                 
22-sep-2006 NvE IceDwalk extended for specification of maximum number of hits per OM,
                to allow comparison with Sieglinde (which only uses the first OM hit).
                Also IceDwalk now introduces a device into the event named "IceDwalk"
                which contains the values of all the used reconstruction parameters.
25-oct-2006 NvE Spread of Psi median included in track fit statistics of IceChi2
                and IcePandel.
                Processing parameters of IceCalibrate, IceXtalk, IceCleanHits, IceChi2
                and IcePandel included as the corresponding devices in the event structure. 
15-nov-2006 NvE Separate treatment of v_phase and v_group introduced in IceDwalk, IceChi2
                and IcePandel to improve time residuals (thanks to George Japaridze).
                Also IceLinefit extended for specification of maximum number of hits per OM
                and automatic introduction of a device into the event named "IceLinefit"
                which contains the values of all the used reconstruction parameters and
                the beta value (v/c) of the reconstructed track.
16-nov-2006 NvE Class IceDwalk renamed to IceDwalkx to provide a Sieglinde-like direct
                walk-II approach. The remaining class IceDwalk will provide a more
                sophisticated approach with more physics driven selection criteria.
23-nov-2006 NvE Improved version of IceDwalk installed. Note that the old algorithm is
                still available as IceDwalkx.
22-jan-2007 NvE New class IceMakeHits introduced to perform waveform feature extraction.
23-jan-2007 NvE Bug fixed by Garmt in IceMakeHits.cxx.
