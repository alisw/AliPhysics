	EVE-dev branch

	* RGBrowser.cxx:
	* RGTopFrame.cxx:
	Use RenderElement* as user-data of list-tree entries (it was
	TObject* before).

	* LinkDef.h:
	* RenderElement.cxx:
	* RenderElement.h:
	Added class RenderElementObjPtr to allow display and control of
	pure TObjects (see alice-macros/region_marker.C for an
	example). This is not perfect as there is no way to get
	color-change updates from the editor (can fix this when i get
	control over TGedEditor::Update()). RenderElement::GetObject() is
	now virtual.

	* Reve.cxx:
	* Reve.h:
	Added function FindColorVar() to allow RenderElementObjPtr objects
	to peek into appropriate color.

	EVE-dev branch

	* BoxSet.cxx:
	* BoxSet.h:
	Do not initialize bbox in ctor. Moved ctor to cxx file, removed
	Init().

	* RGBrowser.cxx:
	* RGBrowser.h:
	Fix for editor window not appearing under some window
	managers. For me it was working OK under fvwm and KDE (any focus
	policy) but not at all under Gnome. This fixed my gnome problem
	but it's quite likely the problem is not completely solved.

	EVE-dev branch

	* RGTopFrame.cxx:
	Added missing initializations. In particular, fCurrentEvent,
	fCurrentEventLTI and fGeometryLTI were not initialized and this
	caused segvs for usage without bootstrap with alieve_init.C macro.

	* LinkDef.h:

	Pragmas for BoxSet/GL.

	* ChangeLog:
	New file.
