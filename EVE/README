EVE - Event Visualization Environment
=====================================

EVE is composed of:
1. small application kernel;
2. graphics classes with editors and OpenGL renderers;
3. CINT scripts that extract data, fill graphics classes and register
   them to the application.

This is an early release ... expect problems and be sure that what you
need is not supported.


Usage
=====

1. Initialize ALICE environment.

2. Spawn 'reve' executable and invoke the alieve_init.C macro, for example:

To load first event from current directory:
   # reve  alieve_init.C 
To load 5th event from directory /data/my-pp-run:
   # reve 'alieve_init.C("/data/my-pp-run", 5)' 
Interactively:
   # reve
   root[0] .L alieve_init.C
   root[1] alieve_init("/somedir")

3. Use GUI or CINT command-line to invoke further visualization macros.
  
See files in EVE/alice-macros/. For specific uses these should be
edited to suit your needs.


Directory structure
===================

EVE is split into two modules: REVE (ROOT part, not dependent on
AliROOT) and ALIEVE (ALICE specific part). For the time being both
modules are kept in AliROOT CVS.

Alieve/ and Reve/ -- sources

macros/		  -- macros for bootstraping and internal steering
alice-macros/	  -- macros for ALICE visualization
alica-data/	  -- data files used by ALICE macros

bin/, Makefile and make_base.inc are used for stand-alone build of the
packages.
