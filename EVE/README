EVE - Event Visualization Environment
=====================================

EVE is composed of:
1. small application kernel;
2. graphics classes with editors and OpenGL renderers;
3. CINT scripts that extract data, fill graphics classes and register
   them to the application.

The framework is still evolving ... some things might not work as expected.


Usage
=====

1. Initialize ALICE environment.

2. Spawn 'alieve' executable and invoke the alieve_init.C macro, for example:

To load first event from current directory:
   # alieve  alieve_init.C 
To load 5th event from directory /data/my-pp-run:
   # alieve 'alieve_init.C("/data/my-pp-run", 5)' 
Interactively:
   # alieve
   root[0] .L alieve_init.C
   root[1] alieve_init("/somedir")

3. Use GUI or CINT command-line to invoke further visualization macros.

4. To navigate the events use macros 'event_next.C' and 'event_prev.C'.
   These are equivalent to the command-line invocations:
   root[x] Alieve::gEvent->NextEvent()
or
   root[x] Alieve::gEvent->PrevEvent()
The general form to go to event via its number is:
   root[x] Alieve::gEvent->GotoEvent(<event-number>)

See files in EVE/alice-macros/. For specific uses these should be
edited to suit your needs.


Directory structure
===================

EVE is split into two modules: REVE (ROOT part, not dependent on
AliROOT) and ALIEVE (ALICE specific part). For the time being both
modules are kept in AliROOT CVS.

Alieve/ and Reve/ -- sources

macros/		  -- macros for bootstraping and internal steering
alice-macros/	  -- macros for ALICE visualization
alica-data/	  -- data files used by ALICE macros
test-macros/      -- macros for tests of specific features; usually one needs
                     to copy and edit them

bin/, Makefile and make_base.inc are used for stand-alone build of the
packages.


Examples
========

1. Run the interface for visual scanning:

alieve -mode 2 trackcount_init.C


Notes
=====

1. Problems with macro-execution
--------------------------------

A failed macro-execution can leave CINT in a poorly defined state that
prevents further execution of macros. For example:

  Exception Reve::Exc_t: Event::Open failed opening ALICE ESDfriend from
  '/alice-data/coctail_10k/AliESDfriends.root'.

  root [1] Error: Function MUON_geom() is not defined in current scope  :0:
  *** Interpreter error recovered ***
  Error: G__unloadfile() File "/tmp/MUON_geom.C" not loaded  :0:

'gROOT->Reset()' helps in most of the cases.

This has been fixed for most cases.
