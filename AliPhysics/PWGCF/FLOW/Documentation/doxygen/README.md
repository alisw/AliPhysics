What is considered the `FLOW package` is all code in 
- libPWGflowBase
- libPWGflowTasks

This manual will explain how the framework is designed and how
it can be used to do analysis in either ROOT or AliROOT. 

Introduction
============

The `ALICE flow package`[1] contains most known flow analysis methods.
The package itself consists of two parts

1.  The ‘tasks’ library, which can be considered to be the `ALICE`
    interface to the package and takes care of e.g. track cuts, event
    cuts, etc;

2.  The ‘base’ library, which is the core of the package and contains
    the actual implementation of flow analysis methods such as the
    scalar product method, Q-cumulant method, etc. This part of the
    package has no dependencies other than `ROOT` and can be used on any
    type of input data.

This manual
-----------

This manual is designed to get you started with using the flow package.
It is written in the following way:

-   Chapter [`On The Fly`](#onthefly) is designed to get you started on a short
    Monte Carlo example. In this example you will use the flow package
    to generate toy Monte Carlo events and analyze them;

-   Chapter [`The program`](#theprogram) describes the flow package itself in detail.
    This includes a brief discussion on the structure of the package,
    sections on track and event cuts, an explanation of some relevant
    code sections and ending with an example analysis of
    v<sub>2</sub>(p<sub>T</sub>) of charged pions with the
    Q-cumulant method. Most of this chapter pertains to the ‘tasks (the
    `AliPhysics`)’ part of the flow package (i.e. event cuts, track cuts,
    PID, etc), but it is also explained how to do flow analysis in
    `ROOT` only on a `TTree`;

-   Chapter [`Methods`](#methods) gives an overview of the available flow
    analysis methods. For the theory behind the methods references to
    papers are given. Settings relevant to the specific implementation
    are given as well.

-   Lastly, [`Exotic`](#exotic) explains how the flow package can be
    put to use in more ‘exotic’ environments, such as an invariant mass
    method estimate of flow of rapidly decaying particles.

Disclaimer
----------

What this manual is *not* designed for is letting the analyzer use the
flow package as a ‘black box’. It is supposed to be a starting point, to
give an overview of the design of the software and point you to relevant
classes, but in the end, the analyzer is responsible for understanding
what is happening and using the software in a proper way. Configurations
of the package which may work on a technical level (i.e. produce output)
do not necessarily mean that the output is what you expect it to be!
Always make sure that you understand what you are doing, and when in
doubt, browse through the source code or consult an expert. The package
is not a static entity, users are encouraged to make additions, be it
track cuts, bug fixes, additional analysis methods, etc, etc. If you
have suggestions, questions, commit requests, send an email to the
flow-pag mailing list or to `rbertens @ cern`.

A Quick Start
=============

We’ll begin with a hands-on exercise in which you’ll get acquainted with
some aspects of the flow package in a few minutes. We’ll do this by
generating a few simple toy Monte Carlo events and performing a flow
analysis on these simulated events without writing them (the events) to
disk, a so called ‘flow analysis on-the-fly’[2].

<a name="onthefly"></a>
On the fly - getting started on a Toy MC
----------------------------------------
The steps which will be followed in this example will be the same as the
steps we take when performing an analysis on data[3]:

1.  Prepare your `(Ali)ROOT` session by loaded the necessary libraries

2.  Create the analysis method objects

3.  Initialize the methods (which creates their histograms)

4.  Define track cuts

5.  Create flow events, which is a container class holding all necessary
    information (e.g. tracks) for the flow analysis of an
    event (collision) and actually do the analysis

6.  Finish the analysis, which will calculate the final
    v<sub>n</sub> values

7.  Write the results to an output file

In this Monte Carlo exercise, the flow event class will not receive data
from a detector, but instead generate toy events itself.

We will now go through these step one-by-one. All the code that is used
can also be found in the macro `runFlowOnTheFlyExample.C`[4].

-  To use the flow code the flow library needs to be loaded. In
    `(Ali)ROOT`:

~~~{.cxx}
        gSystem->Load("libPWGflowBase");
~~~

-  We need to instantiate the flow analysis methods which we want
    to use. In this example we will instantiate two methods: one which
    calculates the flow versus the Monte Carlo event plane (this our
    reference value: as the event plane orientation is known by this
    method, the v<sub>2</sub> value we retrieve should be equal to the
    input *v*<sub>2</sub> by definition) and as a second method the so
    called Q-cumulant analysis.

~~~{.cxx}
        AliFlowAnalysisWithMCEventPlane *mcep = new AliFlowAnalysisWithMCEventPlane();
        AliFlowAnalysisWithQCumulants *qc = new AliFlowAnalysisWithQCumulants();
~~~

-  Each of the methods needs to be initialized (e.g. to define the
    histograms):

~~~{.cxx}
        mcep->Init(); 
        qc->Init();
~~~

-  To define the particles we are going to use as Reference Particles
    (RP’s, particles used for the <span>**Q**</span> vector) and the
    Particles Of Interest (POI’s, the particles of which we calculate
    the differential flow) we have to define two track cut objects:

~~~{.cxx}
        AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts *cutsRP = new AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts();
        AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts *cutsPOI = new AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts();
        cutsPOI->SetPtMin(0.2);
        cutsPOI->SetPtMax(2.0); 
~~~
    Particles will be selected as either POI or RP depending on whether
    or not they pass these cuts.

-  Now we are ready to start the analysis. For a quick start we create
    a toy Monte Carlo event, tag the reference particles and particles
    of interest (which means that, if a particle passes the POI or RP
    cuts, it is flagged as ‘POI’ or ‘RP’) and pass it to the two
    flow methods.

    Since we want to analyze more than one event, this step is performed
    in loop. First define the number of events that need to be created,
    their multiplicity, and a value v<sub>2</sub> value, which can
    either be supplied as a fixed number (no
    p<sub>T</sub> dependence) or a function (to generate
    p<sub>T</sub> differential flow[5]

~~~{.cxx}
        Int_t nEvents = 1000;   // generate 1000 events
        Int_t mult = 2000;      // use track multiplicity of 2000
        Double_t v2 = .05;      // 5 pct integrated flow
        // or sample differential flow
        TF1* diffv2 = new TF1("diffv2", "((x<1.)*(0.1/1.)*x+(x>=1.)*0.1)", 0., 20.); 
~~~
    Now we have all the ingredients to our first flow analysis

~~~{.cxx}
        for(Int_t i=0; i<nEvents; i++) { 
            // make an event with mult particles 
            AliFlowEventSimple* flowevent = AliFlowEventSimple(mult,AliFlowEventSimple::kGenerate);
            // modify the tracks adding the flow value v2
            flowevent->AddV2(diffv2);
            // select the particles for the reference flow
            flowevent->TagRP(cutsRP);
            // select the particles for differential flow
            flowevent->TagPOI(cutsPOI);
            // do flow analysis with various methods:
            mcep->Make(flowevent);
            qc->Make(flowevent);
            // delete the event from memory
            delete flowevent;
        } 
~~~

-  To fill the histograms which contain the final results we have to
    call Finish for each method:

~~~{.cxx}
        mcep->Finish(); 
        qc->Finish(); 
~~~

-  This concludes the analysis and now we can write the results into
    a file. Two options for writing the input to a file are available:

    -   Create a new output file and write the output to this file

~~~{.cxx}
            TFile *outputFile = new TFile("outputMCEPanalysis.root","RECREATE");
            mcep->WriteHistograms();
            TFile *outputFile = new TFile("outputQCanalysis.root","RECREATE");
            qc->WriteHistograms();
~~~
        Please note that this will create a new output file, and
        overwrite any existing file called `AnalysisResults.root`.

    -   To write the output of multiple analyses into sub-directories of
        one file, one can do the following:

~~~{.cxx}
            TFile *outputFile = new TFile("AnalysisResults.root","RECREATE");
            TDirectoryFile* dirQC = new TDiretoryFile("outputQCanalysis", "outputQCanalysis");
            qc->WriteHistograms(dirQC);
            TDirectoryFile* dirMCEP = new TDiretoryFile("outputMCEPanalysis", "outputMCEPanalysis");
            mcep->WriteHistograms(dirMCEP);
~~~
    Note that `AnalysisResults.root` is the default name given to
    analyses in `AliROOT`. Many macros in `AliROOT` will expect a file
    `AnalyisResults.root` as input, so for most users it will be
    convenient to follow this convention.

    When done with running the analysis, do not forget to write the file
    to disk by calling

~~~{.cxx}
        TFile::Close(); // write the buffered file to disk 
~~~

What is in the output file ?
----------------------------

Now we have written the results into a file, but what is in there?

Although the output of different flow analysis techniques might differ
slightly as a result of their different approaches at estimating
v<sub>2</sub>, the output files containers are always constructed in a
similar way.

<a name="commonhists"></a>
### AliFlowCommonHists - Output objects

Objects of two types are stored in the output of the flow analysis[6]

-  `AliFlowCommonHist`, which is a class that contains common
    histograms for the flow analysis (e.g. QA histograms and histograms
    that contain the analysis flags which were used). Depending on the
    type of flow analysis that was used, this object contains histograms
    from the following list:

~~~{.cxx}
          Bool_t    fBookOnlyBasic;       // book and fill only control histos needed for all methods
          TH1F*     fHistMultRP;          // multiplicity for RP selection
          TH1F*     fHistMultPOI;         // multiplicity for POI selection
          TH2F*     fHistMultPOIvsRP;     // multiplicity for POI versus RP
          TH1F*     fHistPtRP;            // pt distribution for RP selection
          TH1F*     fHistPtPOI;           // pt distribution for POI selection
          TH1F*     fHistPtSub0;          // pt distribution for subevent 0
          TH1F*     fHistPtSub1;          // pt distribution for subevent 1
          TH1F*     fHistPhiRP;           // phi distribution for RP selection
          TH1F*     fHistPhiPOI;          // phi distribution for POI selection
          TH1F*     fHistPhiSub0;         // phi distribution for subevent 0
          TH1F*     fHistPhiSub1;         // phi distribution for subevent 1
          TH1F*     fHistEtaRP;           // eta distribution for RP selection
          TH1F*     fHistEtaPOI;          // eta distribution for POI selection
          TH1F*     fHistEtaSub0;         // eta distribution for subevent 0
          TH1F*     fHistEtaSub1;         // eta distribution for subevent 1
          TH2F*     fHistPhiEtaRP;        // eta vs phi for RP selection
          TH2F*     fHistPhiEtaPOI;       // eta vs phi for POI selection
          TProfile* fHistProMeanPtperBin; // mean pt for each pt bin (for POI selection)
          TH2F*     fHistWeightvsPhi;     // particle weight vs particle phi
          TH1F*     fHistQ;               // Qvector distribution
          TH1F*     fHistAngleQ;          // distribution of angle of Q vector
          TH1F*     fHistAngleQSub0;      // distribution of angle of subevent 0 Q vector
          TH1F*     fHistAngleQSub1;      // distribution of angle of subevent 1 Q vector
          TProfile* fHarmonic;            // harmonic 
          TProfile* fRefMultVsNoOfRPs;    // <reference multiplicity> versus # of RPs
          TH1F*     fHistRefMult;         // reference multiplicity distribution
          TH2F*     fHistMassPOI;         // mass distribution for POI selection 
~~~
    This information is from the header file of the AliFlowCommonHist
    object[7]

-  `AliFlowCommonHistResults` is an object designed to hold the common
    results of the flow analysis[8]. The possible common histograms
    stored in this object are

~~~{.cxx}
          TH1D* fHistIntFlow; // reference flow
          TH1D* fHistChi;     // resolution
          // RP = Reference Particles:  
          TH1D* fHistIntFlowRP;     // integrated flow of RPs
          TH1D* fHistDiffFlowPtRP;  // differential flow (Pt) of RPs
          TH1D* fHistDiffFlowEtaRP; // differential flow (Eta) of RPs
          // POI = Particles Of Interest:
          TH1D* fHistIntFlowPOI;     // integrated flow of POIs
          TH1D* fHistDiffFlowPtPOI;  // differential flow (Pt) of POIs
          TH1D* fHistDiffFlowEtaPOI; // differential flow (Eta) of POIs 
~~~

The titles of the histograms in the output object differ from the names
of the pointers given in the two lists printed above, but the lists give
an overview of what is available; the easiest way however of getting
acquainted with where to find histograms in the output is browsing them
in `ROOT’s TBrowser`.

~~~{.cxx}
      new TBrowser(); 
~~~

The `AliFlowCommonHist` and `AliFlowCommonHistResults` classes are
derived from the generic `TNamed` `ROOT` object and can be written to a
`ROOT` file. The flow analysis tasks will, as output, write the complete
`AliFlowCommonHist` and `AliFlowCommonHistResults` objects to file at
the end of an analysis. To read the content of these objects, the
`libPWGflowBase` library must be loaded in your `ROOT` session.

#### Comparing flow results

A convenient way of comparing the results of the different flow analysis
strategies that have been used is invoking the macro
`compareFlowResults.C`[9]. This macro will read the analysis output file
`AnalysisResults.root`, extract the requested results from it and plot
them. For a full overview of what can be done with the macro, the reader
is referred to the macro itself and its ample documentation. To run the
macro on the data-set that we have just generated, simply do

~~~{.cxx}
    .L compareFlowResults.C
    compareFlowResults(TSring(""))  // the empty suffix indicates on the fly events 
~~~

The Program
===========

The basic idea behind the flow package is that from whatever input you
have, a *flow event* is constructed, which is then passed to one or more
flow analysis methods (e.g. the scalar product method or Q-cumulant
method). The flow event is a collection of *flow tracks*, which are
simple objects carrying only the kinematic information that is necessary
to do flow analysis. By setting up the flow package in this way, the
flow analysis methods can analyze input from various sources, be it
ALICE data, Monte Carlo events, STAR data, etc, etc, as long as the flow
event is properly filled . This might all sound a bit abstract at this
point; this chapter however will explain all details and relevant
classes in detail. For those who are impatient and prefer seeing the
flow package in action, section [`Examples`](#examples) gives a step-by-step
example of doing a π<sup> ± </sup> v<sub>2</sub> analysis in the
`AliROOT` analysis framework.

Overview
--------

Input events (in the case of the figure this is either
ESDs or AODs) pass a set of event cuts (the common cuts) and are then
converted to a flow event (stored as an `AliFlowEventSimple` object).
This flow event holds a collection of flow tracks (`AliFlowTrackSimple`
objects) which are passed to flow analysis methods. The only steps of
this flow chart which depend on `AliROOT` libraries are the ones
handling `ALICE` data types (the ESDs or AODs). The rest of the analysis
chain (the `AliFlowEventSimple` and the analysis methods) have no
specific `AliROOT` dependence and are just simple `c++` objects.
Therefore, the flow package is split into two libraries

- libPWGflowBase  
        - The base library, which has no specific `AliROOT` dependencies. This
        library holds objects such as the `AliFlowEventSimple` and
        `AliFlowTrackSimple`, and analysis methods classes. The analysis methods
        classes follow the naming scheme: `AliFlowAnalysisWith\* where  \* 
        denotes a specific analysis method. All classes which end up in the
        shared object can be found in `$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/Base`;

- libPWGflowTasks  
        - The tasks library, which has specific `AliROOT` dependencies. Contrary
        to what the name suggests, this library does not just hold tasks, but
        actually comprises all classes of the flow package which need to include
        `AliROOT` specific classes. This ranges from classes to read the AOD or
        ESD input data (important examples are the `AliFlowEvent` and
        `AliFlowTrackCuts`, which will be discussed later on in this chapter)
        and the `AliAnalysisTask\*` classes, which are analysis tasks, derived
        from `AliAnalysisTaskSE` which can be used in the `AliROOT` analysis
        framework and are actually just interface classes to the underlying flow
        analysis methods of libPWGflowBase. The classes which are bundled into
        the shared object can be found in `$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/Tasks`;

Some tools, such as the flow event or track cuts, have a ‘base’
component which name ends with the suffix ‘simple’, and an ‘tasks’
(`AliROOT`) component which does not have this suffix. The ‘tasks’ class
in these cases inherits from the ‘base’ class.

Every flow analysis in the flow package starts with the flow event. As
mentioned earlier, the flow event is a simple container class which
holds a collection of flow tracks, which are in turn fed to the flow
analysis methods. In the next section it will be explained how the flow
event can be filled with `ALICE` data in the `AliROOT` analysis
framework. The section after that will explain how the flow event can be
filled with *any* type of data using just `ROOT`

Analysis in the ALICE analysis framework
----------------------------------------

In this section, you will see how a flow analysis can be performed in
the `AliROOT` analysis framework.

### Input data

Before passing the flow event to the flow analysis methods, it needs to
be filled with a set of flow tracks. In general, a distinction is made
between *reference particles* (or *RP’s*), which are particles that are
used to build the **Q** vector(s), and *particles of interest* (or
*POI’s*), which are the particles of which you’ll calculate the
differential flow. The flow event and the flow analysis methods are
designed to keep track of which flow tracks are POI’s, RP’s (or even
both at the same time), which is important to avoid auto-correlation
effects which can distort the *v*<sub>*n*</sub> measurement. The user of
the flow package however is responsible for properly setting up the
analysis!

The flow event can be filled with input from many sources. In the second
chapter of this manual, a simple method has been shown where the flow
event (the `AliFlowEventSimple` object) fills itself by generating a set
of Monte Carlo tracks by sampling kinematic variables from supplied
p.d.f.’s. Using this method is a very effective tool for testing and
developing new flow analysis methods (if you generate events with a
certain *v*<sub>2</sub>(*p*<sub>*t*</sub>) and then retrieve the same
*v*<sub>2</sub>(*p*<sub>*t*</sub>) from your flow analysis method, you
can use that as a tool to proof the validation of your analysis method)
but if you want to do a data analysis, a somewhat more advanced - but
not difficult - approach is necessary.

Filling a flow event from data can be performed either ‘by-hand’ (which
is covered in section [`Exotic`](#exotic) on more exotic analyses), but the
most commonly used method of filling a flow event in the `AliROOT`
analysis framework is using the dedicated task
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent`.

The idea behind this is the following:

1.  Setup the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` task to receive input
    events (e.g. `AODs`, `ESDs`, `MC`, …;

2.  Define two sets of track selection criteria (colloquially referred
    to as *track cuts*), one for POI’s and one for RP’s;

3.  Pass these two sets of track cuts to the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent`;

4.  The `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` will convert the tracks of each input
    event to a set of `AliFlowSimpleTracks`. Depending on whether or not
    a track passes the track selection for POI’s or RP’s, the
    `AliFlowSimpleTrack` is labeled as a POI or RP (or both. In the case
    where a track does not meet any of the track selection criteria, it
    is omitted from the `AliFlowSimpleTrack` collection and not added to
    the flow event);

5.  All the `AliFlowSimpleTracks` are added to the flow event which is
    passed to the flow analysis methods.

### Event selection

When using the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` task to create your flow
event, the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` task is responsible for ensuring
that only good quality tracks enter into your analysis by making
sensible track selections. The first step however at safeguarding track
quality is making sure that the events that are accepted by
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` pass sane event selection criteria.

#### Trigger selection

A certain combination a of detector signals (a *trigger*) is required
for an event to be written to storage. Different types of analyses might
require different types of events, and hence, different types of
triggers.

You can set a trigger by calling

~~~{.cxx}
    AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent::SelectCollisionCandidates(UInt_t offlineTriggerMask);
~~~

where `offlineTriggerMask` is the trigger mask corresponding to the
desired trigger. A list of all available triggers, with a short
descrption, can be found in the header file of the `AliVEvent`
class[10]. This function, however, is not implement in the
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` itself, but rather in the base class of which
most of the analysis task classes within `AliROOT` are derived: the
`AliAnalysisTaskSE` class (which is designed to handle a single event,
hence the suffix ‘SE’). For each event that is written from a file, but
function `AliAnalysisTaskSE::Exec()` is called, which - among other
things - checks if an event passes the requested trigger selection, and
if so, calls the `UserExec()` function of your analysis task. In the
case of the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` this is the
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent::UserExec()`, which creates
`AliFlowSimpleTracks` and fills the flow event.

A general remark about trigger selection in flow analyses is that the
non-uniform acceptance correction methods that are implemented in the
flow package assume a flat **Q** vector distribution. Specific triggers
(e.g. EMCal triggers) result in a **Q** vector bias which should *not*
be corrected as they invalidate that assumption. A safe approach is
therefore using a minimum bias trigger for your analysis (such as
`AliVEvent::kMB`), other triggers selections will not a-priori lead to
problems, but use them with caution!

#### Event cuts

In addition to trigger selection, generally one wants to perform
additional event (quality) selection. The flow package contains an event
cuts class which can be used to perform event selection, the
`AliFlowEventCuts` object[11].

To use the event cuts object in combination with the
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` task, simply create the event cuts object,
configure it and pass it to the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent`:

~~~{.cxx}
      AliFlowEventCuts* cutsEvent = new AliFlowEventCuts("EventCuts");
      // configure some event cuts, e.g. centrality
      cutsEvent->SetCentralityPercentileRange(20., 30.);
      // pass it to the flow event task via the setter
      AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent::SetCutsEvent(cutsEvent);
~~~

The available cut parameters in the flow event cuts object are

~~~{.cxx}
      Bool_t fCutNumberOfTracks;//cut on # of tracks
      Int_t fNumberOfTracksMax;  //limits
      Int_t fNumberOfTracksMin;  //limits
      Bool_t fCutRefMult; //cut on refmult
      refMultMethod fRefMultMethod; //how do we calculate refmult?
      Bool_t fUseAliESDtrackCutsRefMult; //use AliESDtrackCuts for refmult calculation
      AliESDtrackCuts::MultEstTrackType fRefMultMethodAliESDtrackCuts;
      Int_t fRefMultMax; //max refmult
      Int_t fRefMultMin; //min refmult
      AliFlowTrackCuts* fRefMultCuts; //cuts
      AliFlowTrackCuts* fMeanPtCuts; //mean pt cuts
      AliFlowTrackCuts* fStandardTPCcuts; //Standard TPC cuts
      AliFlowTrackCuts* fStandardGlobalCuts; //StandardGlobalCuts
      Bool_t fCutPrimaryVertexX; //cut on x of prim vtx
      Double_t fPrimaryVertexXmax; //max x prim vtx
      Double_t fPrimaryVertexXmin; //min x prim vtx
      Bool_t fCutPrimaryVertexY; //cut on y of prim vtx

#### Caveats and remarks

Some caveats and remarks about using the event cuts object

Default behavior  
By default, the event cuts object accepts all events. All desired cuts
have to be set by the user. This is also reflected in the design of the
setters: most of the setters will, when called, set a `Bool_t` to true
which enables a cut on a certain parameter;

Applicability of cuts to different data types  
Not all the cuts can be applied to all input data types. In e.g. the
process of filtering `AODs` from `ESDs`, ‘technical’ event cuts are made
and not all events are stored in the `AOD` format. Because of this,
information that can be required from `ESDs` might not be available (as
it is not necessary) in `AODs`. To see whether or not a cut you set is
actually applied to the data type you’re using, take a look at

~~~{.cxx}
    Bool_t AliFlowEventCuts::PassesCuts(AliVEvent *event, ALIMCEvent *mcevent)
~~~

This function determines whether or not an event is accepted: it starts
by converting the virtual event type that is passed as argument to
either an `ESD` or `AOD` event, and goes through selection
criteria accordingly.

Event cuts outside of the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` class  
When you perform a flow analysis without using the
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` class (which is done e.g. in the analyses
explained in section [`Exotic`](#exotic), you can still use the event cuts
class by creating an instance of the object, passing it to your analysis
class and ‘manually’ checking the return value of the function

~~~{.cxx}
    Bool_t AliFlowEventCuts::PassesCuts(AliVEvent *event, ALIMCEvent *mcevent)
~~~

Data taking period  
Most event cuts will be tuned specifically to the LHC10h or LHC11h data
taking periods. The event cuts class might need to be updated to
accommodate specific cuts for different periods - do not hesitate write
patches for this!

for e.g. each event that is passed to your `::UserExec()` function.

### Track cuts and the track cuts object

As explained in the previous subsection, flow events are filled with
tracks which fulfill certain track selection criteria. These criteria
are checked using the `AliFlowTrackCuts` class. The `AliFlowTrackCuts`
class can handle different types of input from different data-types
(e.g. `ESD` or `AOD`) and information from different sub-detector
systems. All input is in the end converted to `AliFlowSimpleTracks`
which are added to the flow event. To understand how the
`AliFlowTrackCuts` object works and how it should be configured, it is
good to make a few distinctions and remarks.

The term ‘track’ is generally used for reconstructed particle
trajectories which are constructed from information coming from the
tracking detectors in central barrel of the `ALICE` detector (more
specifically from information from the `ITS` and `TPC` detectors).
Tracks are the most commonly used data source, and the translation from
‘track’ to `AliFlowTrackSimple` is trivial, as it merely comprises
copying kinematic information (*p*<sub>*t*</sub>, *φ*, *η*) from the
barrel track to the `AliFlowTrackSimple` object.

When using information that is not coming from tracking detectors, e.g.
information from the `VZERO` system, this procedure of simply copying
variables is not suitable as the `VZERO` system does not measure
*p*<sub>*t*</sub>, *φ*, *η* of particles, but is an array of
scintillators with limited spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the
`AliFlowTrackCuts` class converts the `VZERO` signal to
`AliFlowTrackSimples` which are, to the flow event, indistinguishable
from barrel tracks. As the procedure of accepting these tracks is very
different from the procedure of accepting barrel tracks, they will be
treated separately in the following subsections.

#### ESD tracks as data source

The safest and most convenient way of using `ESD` tracks as a data
source is by using one of the pre-defined track cuts sets that are
available in the `AliFlowTrackCuts` class. These sets of track cuts
mimic the cuts that are defined in the `AliESDtrackCuts` class[12]. The
following default track cuts sets are available:

~~~{.cxx}
      static AliFlowTrackCuts* GetStandardTPCStandaloneTrackCuts();
      static AliFlowTrackCuts* GetStandardTPCStandaloneTrackCuts2010();
      static AliFlowTrackCuts* GetStandardGlobalTrackCuts2010();
      static AliFlowTrackCuts* GetStandardITSTPCTrackCuts2009(Bool_t selPrimaries=kTRUE);
      static AliFlowTrackCuts* GetStandardMuonTrackCuts(Bool_t isMC=kFALSE, Int_t passN=2);
~~~
     

All these are static methods which create a new track cuts object and
configure it properly, so to use these track cuts it suffices to type
e.g.

~~~{.cxx}
    AliFlowTrackCuts* myCuts = AliFlowTrackCuts::GetStandardGlobalTrackCuts2010();
~~~

To get a better understanding of what the `AliFlowTrackCuts` class
actually does, let’s take a look at what how the cut object is
configured in this case:

~~~{.cxx}
    AliFlowTrackCuts* AliFlowTrackCuts::GetStandardGlobalTrackCuts2010()
    {
      //get standard cuts
      AliFlowTrackCuts* cuts = new AliFlowTrackCuts("standard Global tracks");
      cuts->SetParamType(kGlobal);
      cuts->SetPtRange(0.2,5.);
      cuts->SetEtaRange(-0.8,0.8);
      cuts->SetMinNClustersTPC(70);
      cuts->SetMinChi2PerClusterTPC(0.1);
      cuts->SetMaxChi2PerClusterTPC(4.0);
      cuts->SetMinNClustersITS(2);
      cuts->SetRequireITSRefit(kTRUE);
      cuts->SetRequireTPCRefit(kTRUE);
      cuts->SetMaxDCAToVertexXY(0.3);
      cuts->SetMaxDCAToVertexZ(0.3);
      cuts->SetAcceptKinkDaughters(kFALSE);
      cuts->SetMinimalTPCdedx(10.);
      return cuts;
    }
~~~

The configuration falls into three categories:

1.  A number of track quality cuts is set;

2.  Some kinematic cuts are set;

3.  The parameter type is set by calling
    `AliFlowTrackCuts::SetParamType()` (in this case to
    `AliFlowTrackCuts::kGlobal`). This last step is of particular
    importance as it takes care disentangling the POI and RP selection
    and removing a *v*<sub>*n*</sub> bias due to auto-correlations. When
    the flow event is filled (the relevant piece of code is printed
    under section [`Fill](#fill), a check is done to see if the POI’s and
    RP’s are of the same type. If not, a track cannot be a POI and RP at
    the same time (as they are from different sources). However, if
    POI’s and RP’s originate from the same source, an
    `AliFlowTrackSimple` can be both a POI and RP at the same time if it
    satisfies both the POI and RP track selection criteria. By
    specifying the parameter type by calling
    `AliFlowTrackCuts::SetParamType()` the flow event is configured to
    properly deal with overlapping or exclusive POI and RP selections. A
    wrongly configured parameter type can lead to double counting of
    tracks and nonsensical analysis results! The following list of track
    parameter types is available as an `enum` in `AliFlowTrackCuts.h`

~~~{.cxx}
          enum trackParameterType { kMC, 
                                    kGlobal, 
                                    kTPCstandalone, 
                                    kSPDtracklet,
                                    kPMD,
                                    kV0,    //neutral reconstructed v0 particle
                                    kVZERO, //forward VZERO detector
                                    kMUON,
                                    kKink,
                                    kAODFilterBit,
                                    kUserA,     // reserved for custom cuts
                                    kUserB      // reserved for custom cuts
                                  };
~~~
    Note that `kV0` is reserved to denote a decay vertex of a neutral
    particle, and `kVZERO` is used to indicate the VZERO
    detector system. kUserA and kUserB are additional flags which can
    selected for ‘custom’ track selection sets.

#### AOD tracks as data source

`AOD` tracks are derived from `ESD` tracks via process called
‘filtering’. If an `ESD` track meets a pre-defined set of track cuts, it
is converted to an `AOD` track which is stored in an `AOD` event. The
`AOD` track carries a specific flag (called `filterbit`) which
corresponds to the specific set of cuts that was applied to create
accept the track. A full list of track selection criteria corresponding
to distinct filterbits can be found [here](). Note that different `AOD`
productions might have different filterbit definitions!

In `AOD` analysis it generally suffices to select tracks of a certain
filterbit, instead of checking quality criteria ‘by-hand’ as is done in
`ESD` analyses (some variables which one would cut on in `ESD` tracks
might not even be available in the `AOD` tracks as the `AOD` is designed
to be a light-weight ‘end-user’ data format). To get an instance of the
`AliFlowTrackCuts` object which only selects tracks based on a specific
filterbit, one can call

~~~{.cxx}
     static AliFlowTrackCuts* GetAODTrackCutsForFilterBit(UInt_t bit = 1);
~~~

which is defined as

~~~{.cxx}
     AliFlowTrackCuts* AliFlowTrackCuts::GetAODTrackCutsForFilterBit(UInt_t bit)
    {
      // object which in its default form only cuts on filterbit (for AOD analysis)
      AliFlowTrackCuts* cuts = new AliFlowTrackCuts(Form("AOD fitlerbit %i", (int)bit));
      cuts->SetMinimalTPCdedx(-999999999);
      cuts->SetAODfilterBit(bit);
      cuts->SetParamType(AliFlowTrackCuts::kAODFilterBit);
      return cuts;
    }  
~~~

The `SetMinimalTPCdedx(-999999999);` is kept here for
backward-compatibility.

Note that also in the case of analyses the parameter type is set to (if
necessary) decouple POI and RP selections.

### Additional options

As stated, input data needn’t necessarily come in the form of barrel
tracks - we can use other detector systems as well. When dealing with
barrel tracks, quality criteria might not be the only thing you want to
select your tracks on: perhaps you want to do analysis on identified
particles. The following sub-sections explain how the `AliFlowTrackCuts`
object can be used to achieve this.

#### Identified particles

The `AliFlowTrackCuts` object can do particle selection for a number of
particles that are defined in the AliPID[13]. To enable particle
identification as a selection criterion, call the function

~~~{.cxx}
    void AliFlowTrackCuts::SetPID(
        AliPID::EParticleType pid, 
        PIDsource s=kTOFpid, 
        Double_t prob=0.9)
    {fParticleID=pid; fPIDsource=s; fParticleProbability=prob; fCutPID=kTRUE; InitPIDcuts();
    }
~~~

The first argument specifies the particle species that will be selected
via the `EParticleType` enum. The total list of particles as defined in
the `AliPID` class reads

~~~{.cxx}
      enum EParticleType {
        kElectron = 0, 
        kMuon = 1, 
        kPion = 2, 
        kKaon = 3, 
        kProton = 4, 

        kDeuteron = 5,
        kTriton = 6,
        kHe3 = 7,
        kAlpha = 8,
        
        kPhoton = 9,
        kPi0 = 10, 
        kNeutron = 11, 
        kKaon0 = 12, 
        kEleCon = 13,
        
        kUnknown = 14
      };
~~~

Note that not all these particles may be available for selection via
`AliFlowTrackCuts`!

The second argument tells the `AliFlowTrackCuts` class which particle
identification method should be used. The available methods are

~~~{.cxx}
        enum PIDsource {
                       kTPCpid,      // default TPC pid (via GetTPCpid)
                       kTOFpid,      // default TOF pid (via GetTOFpid)
                       kTOFbayesian, // TOF bayesian pid (F.Noferini)
                       kTOFbeta,     // asymmetric cuts of TOF beta signal
                       kTPCdedx,      // asymmetric cuts of TPC dedx signal
                       kTOFbetaSimple, //simple TOF only cut
                       kTPCbayesian, //bayesian cutTPC
                   kTPCNuclei,   // added by Natasha for Nuclei
                       kTPCTOFNsigma // simple cut on combined tpc tof nsigma
                       };
~~~

The third argument (with a default value of 0.9) gives the analyzer
control over the purity of the particle sample by setting a lower bound
on the probability that a particle is of a certain species (where 0
would mean no selection and 1 -theoretically - means a 100% pure
sample). To see how - and if - this parameter is used in a certain
identification routine, take a look at the source code.

The best way of understanding how particles are identified is by just
browsing the relevant pieces of the code in the `AliFlowTrackCuts.cxx`
file (look at the list of `Passes\*Cuts()`, but to give a very short
overview:

kTPCpid  
        Return particle identity as stored in the `AliESDtrack`, TPC information
only;

kTOFpid  
        Return particle identify as stored in the `AliESDtrack`, TOF information
only;

- kTOFbayesian  
      - Combined TPC and TOF Bayesian PID method;

- kTOFbeta  
      -  PID based on asymmetric TOF *β* cut;

- kTPCdedx  
      -  PID cut using TPC $\\frac{dE}{dx}$ measurements stored in the
        `AliESDtrack`,

- kTOFbetaSimple  
      -  PID cut based on TOF time stored in the `AliESDtrack`;

- kTPCbayesian  
      -  Bayesian cut based on TPC or TOF signal;

- kTPCNuclei  
      -  PID selection for heavy nuclei;

- kTPCTOFNsigma  
      -  Cut based in a simple combined cut on the nσ signal from TPC and
        TOF, requires PID response object. The PID response object is created by
        the PID response task, and thus requires that the PID response task runs
        in an analysis train *before* the `AliFlowTrackCuts` class does
        its selection. To enable the PID response task, add the following lines
        to your run macro:

~~~{.cxx}
    gROOT->LoadMacro("ANALYSIS/macros/AddTaskPIDResponse.C");
    AddTaskPIDResponse();
~~~

The default value for nσ is 3, but it can be set to a different
value using

~~~{.cxx}
    void AliFlowTrackCuts::SetNumberOfSigmas(Float_t val);
~~~

#### Caveats and notes

Applicability of cuts to different data types  
Just as not all event and track cuts that are available for all
data types. For the track quality cuts this has been explained in the
previous subsections, but one has to realize that in addition, not all
particle identification methods are available for all types of data. At
the time of writing, the `ESD` particle identification is more elaborate
than the `AOD` counterpart. To see which PID methods exist for the
different data types, check the `AliFlowTrackCuts::Passes\*pidCut()`
functions, printed below for your convenience.

~~~{.cxx}
    Bool_t AliFlowTrackCuts::PassesAODpidCut(const AliAODTrack* track )
    {
         if(!track->GetAODEvent()->GetTOFHeader()){
              AliAODPid *pidObj = track->GetDetPid();
              if (!pidObj) fESDpid.GetTOFResponse().SetTimeResolution(84.);
              else{
                Double_t sigmaTOFPidInAOD[10];
                pidObj->GetTOFpidResolution(sigmaTOFPidInAOD);
                if(sigmaTOFPidInAOD[0] > 84.){
                  fESDpid.GetTOFResponse().SetTimeResolution(sigmaTOFPidInAOD[0]); // use the electron TOF PID sigma as time resolution (including the T0 used)
              }
            }
         }

     //check if passes the selected pid cut for ESDs
      Bool_t pass = kTRUE;
      switch (fPIDsource)
      {
       case kTOFbeta:
          if (!PassesTOFbetaCut(track)) pass=kFALSE;

      }
      return pass;
    }
~~~

In general, particle identification is not a trivial procedure, and one
needs to find a balance between purity and efficiency. Which particle
identification to choose depends heavily on the desired outcome of
the analysis. In case of e.g. a high-precision measurement of π
v<sub>2</sub>, a method which has a very high purity but low
efficiency can be chosen: π’s are an abundant particle species and
high precision requires high purity. On the other hand, if one does
selection for kaons to reconstruct *φ*-mesons, loose cuts with high
efficiency can be chosen, as the φ-meson is a rare probe and invariant
mass requirements on the kaon pairs will take care
of mis-identifications.

To get access to QA information on track selection *before* and *after*
PID cuts, the QA mode of the `AliFlowTrackCuts` can be selected.

Track cuts outside of the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` class  
Just as the flow event cuts can be used outside of the
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` class, one can use the `AliFlowTrackCuts`
class in a similar way, by calling, for each track,

~~~{.cxx}
    Bool_t AliFlowTrackCuts::IsSelected(TObject* obj, Int_t id)
~~~

or directly one of the `PassesCuts(\*)` functions which
`IsSelected()` calls.

#### VZERO

Now that the barrel tracks have been explained, let’s continue to the
treatment of VZERO information. The VZERO detector consists of two
scintillator arrays at opposite sides of the interaction point (VZEROA
and VZEROC) each containing 32 readout channels. To convert the VZERO
information to `AliFlowTrackCuts`, two steps are taken:

1.  A ‘track’ is built from a VZERO tile by taking the geometric mean of
    the tile as the track direction (from which *η* and *φ* can be
    constructed);

2.  The VZERO analogue signal strength within a VZERO tile (which is
    proportional to charge deposition) is taken as a weight when
    evaluating the total **Q** vector.

As there is no straightforward way to convert VZERO multiplicity to
*p*<sub>*t*</sub>, the VZERO signal can in principle not be used as POI
in the flow analysis, neither can a *p*<sub>*t*</sub> range be selected
when using the VZERO as RP selection. In addition to this, the ‘raw’
VZERO signal itself cannot be used directly for flow analysis but needs
to be calibrated tile-by-tile. To understand how this calibration is
performed in the flow package, we need to go into a little bit of detail
on how to build a **Q** vector.

In general, a **Q** vector is defined as
**Q** = ∑<sub>tracks</sub>w<sub>i</sub>exp(inφ)
 where w<sub>i</sub> is a track weight, n is the harmonic, and φ
is the azimuthal angle of a track. As explained, in the case of VZERO
tiles, φ is derived from the position of the VZERO tile and
w<sub>i</sub> is the VZERO signal which is proportional to
multiplicity. However, not all VZERO tiles are equally sensitive, and
the sensitivity (can have) a run-number dependence, which results in a
non-flat VZERO **Q** vector distribution. As this effect might be
different run-by-run, it cannot be corrected by applying a non-uniform
acceptance correction at the end of your analysis, as an analysis
generally comprises running over multiple run-numbers and the
non-uniform acceptance correction corrects only for non-uniformity which
is equal for all runs. Hence, the VZERO non-uniformity needs to be
corrected at the time of the construction of the **Q** vectors.

The functions in the flow package which are responsible for building the
**Q** vectors (or sub-event **Q** vectors, the use of which will be
described in subsection [`Scalar Product`](#scalarproduct) are

~~~{.cxx}
    // Q-vector  calculation
    AliFlowVector AliFlowEventSimple::GetQ( 
        Int_t n,                // harmonic
        TList *weightsList,         // weight list
        Bool_t usePhiWeights,   // use phi weights?
        Bool_t usePtWeights,    // use pt weights?
        Bool_t useEtaWeights    // use eta weights?
        )

    // Q-vectors of sub-events
    void AliFlowEventSimple::Get2Qsub( 
        AliFlowVector* Qarray,  // array with q-vectors
        Int_t n, 
        TList *weightsList, 
        Bool_t usePhiWeights, 
        Bool_t usePtWeights, 
        Bool_t useEtaWeights 
        )

    // overloaded implementation of Q-vectors of sub-events for VZERO information
    void AliFlowEvent::Get2Qsub(
        AliFlowVector* Qarray, 
        Int_t n, 
        TList *weightsList, 
        Bool_t usePhiWeights, 
        Bool_t usePtWeights, 
        Bool_t useEtaWeights
        )
~~~

These functions are called by the flow analysis tasks and generally not
by the user directly, but it is good to know where they can be found.
The first two functions merely loop over all tracks in a flow event and
fill the **Q** vector. The last function is designed for building a
**Q** vector from VZERO information, applying a calibration step to the
VZERO signal. To make life complicated, the calibration of the VZERO
**Q** vector in LHC10h is not the same as the calibration of the VZERO
**Q** vector LHC11h data. Let’s start by taking a look at the LHC10h
case.

LHC10h  
The calibration of LHC10h data is a two-step procedure.

-   The first step is evaluating the **Q** vector using
    equation \[qvzero\]. However, the VZERO signal of each tile is
    *re-weighted* before it is used as a weight in equation \[qvzero\].
    The re-weighting comprises

    1.  Taking a `TProfile` with average multiplicity per cell (these
        profiles are stored in a `OADB` file for each run-number)

    2.  Fitting a constant line per disc (or ring) *y* = *a* (see next
        slide for example)

    3.  Evaluating the track weight for each VZERO cell is now
        calculated in a second iteration as
        $$\\mbox{track weight} = \\frac{\\mbox{cell multiplicity} \* a}{\\mbox{average multiplicity in a cell}}$$

-   After the **Q** vectors have been built, they are re-centered.
    Re-centering is basically a small adjustment of the components of
    the **Q** vector, changing its angle event-by-event so that on
    average a flat **Q** vector distribution is obtained. The steps that
    are taken for re-centering are the following:

    1.  Retrieve the average mean and spread of the **Q** vector
        distribution from a database file;

    2.  The corrected **Q** vectors can now be obtained by doing
        $$Q\_n \\longrightarrow \\frac{Q\_n - \\langle Q\_n \\rangle }{\\sigma\_{Q\_n}}$$
         where brackets denote the one-run average, and
        σ<sub>Q<sub>n</sub></sub> the standard deviation of
        Q<sub>n</sub> in the sample

Note that the calibration is only available for *n* = 2 and *n* = 3. For
higher harmonics, the flow package will use the equalized VZERO
multiplicity

~~~{.cxx}
    AliVEvent::GetVZEROEqMultiplicity(Int_t i);
~~~

to build the **Q** vectors, whether this is satisfactory for an
analysis, or if non-uniform acceptance effects can be reverted by
performing a correction on a run-by-run basis is up to the analyzer. The
**Q** vector distributions of total **Q** vectors and sub-event vectors
can always be checked via the `AliFlowCommonHists` classes (see
section [`Common Hists`](#commonhists) via

~~~{.cxx}
      TH1F*     GetHistQ()               {return fHistQ; } ;  
      TH1F*     GetHistAngleQ()          {return fHistAngleQ; }
      TH1F*     GetHistAngleQSub0()      {return fHistAngleQSub0; }
      TH1F*     GetHistAngleQSub1()      {return fHistAngleQSub1; }
~~~

LHC11h  
The calibration of the LHC11h VZERO information is not performed by the
flow package, but by an external class, name the VZEROEPselection task,
which will store the corrected **Q** vectors in the AliVEvent header,
from which they are retrieved by the **AliFlowTrackCuts** class. To use
this method, make sure that you run this VZEROEPselection task *before*
your flow analysis tasks in an analysis train. To enable this task, add
the following lines to your analysis macro

~~~{.cxx}
    gROOT->LoadMacro("$ALICE_ROOT/ANALYSIS/macros/AddTaskVZEROEPSelection.C");
    AddTaskVZEROEPSelection();
~~~

Note that for LHC11h data, calibration is performed only for the second
harmonic (*n* = 2). For higher harmonics, the flow package uses
equalized VZERO multiplicity to build **Q** vectors (as indicated for
the LHC10h data).

After describing how and why calibration is performed, it is now time to
indicate how to set up this calibration routine. Just as selecting
barrel tracks, this can be done by creating an `AliFlowTrackCuts` object
via a `static` access method,

~~~{.cxx}
    AliFlowTrackCuts* cutsVZERO = GetStandardVZEROOnlyTrackCuts();
~~~

At run-time, the flow package will detector whether LHC10h or LHC11h
data is used by reading the analyzed events’ run-number. This can be
convenient when having these cuts defined in a script which is designed
to run on multiple types of input data. However, one can also call the
LHC10h or LHC11h specific cuts directly via dedicated functions, which
are reprinted here as the comments are important

~~~{.cxx}
    AliFlowTrackCuts* AliFlowTrackCuts::GetStandardVZEROOnlyTrackCuts2010()
    {
      //get standard VZERO cuts
      //DISCLAIMER: LHC10h VZERO calibration consists (by default) of two steps
      //1) re-weigting of signal
      //2) re-centering of q-vectors
      //step 2 is available only for n==2 and n==3, for the higher harmonics the user
      //is repsonsible for making sure the q-sub distributions are (sufficiently) flat
      //or a sensible NUA procedure is applied !
      AliFlowTrackCuts* cuts = new AliFlowTrackCuts("standard vzero flow cuts");
      cuts->SetParamType(AliFlowTrackCuts::kVZERO);
      cuts->SetEtaRange( -10, +10 );
      cuts->SetEtaGap(-1., 1.);
      cuts->SetPhiMin( 0 );
      cuts->SetPhiMax( TMath::TwoPi() );
      // options for the reweighting
      cuts->SetVZEROgainEqualizationPerRing(kFALSE);
      cuts->SetApplyRecentering(kTRUE);
      // to exclude a ring , do e.g. 
      // cuts->SetUseVZERORing(7, kFALSE);
      // excluding a ring will break the re-centering as re-centering relies on a 
      // database file which tuned to receiving info from all rings
      return cuts;
    }
    //-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    AliFlowTrackCuts* AliFlowTrackCuts::GetStandardVZEROOnlyTrackCuts2011()
    {
      //get standard VZERO cuts for 2011 data
      //in this case, the vzero segments will be weighted by
      //VZEROEqMultiplicity, 
      //if recentering is enableded, the sub-q vectors
      //will be taken from the event header, so make sure to run 
      //the VZERO event plane selection task before this task !
      //DISCLAIMER: recentering is only available for n==2
      //for the higher harmonics the user
      //is repsonsible for making sure the q-sub distributions are (sufficiently) flat
      //or a sensible NUA procedure is applied !
      //recentering replaces the already evaluated q-vectors, so 
      //when chosen, additional settings (e.g. excluding rings) 
      //have no effect. recentering is true by default
      //
      //NOTE user is responsible for running the vzero event plane
      //selection task in advance, e.g. add to your launcher macro
      //
      //  gROOT->LoadMacro("$ALICE_ROOT/ANALYSIS/macros/AddTaskVZEROEPSelection.C");
      //  AddTaskVZEROEPSelection();
      //
      AliFlowTrackCuts* cuts = new AliFlowTrackCuts("standard vzero flow cuts 2011");
      cuts->SetParamType(kVZERO);
      cuts->SetEtaRange( -10, +10 );
      cuts->SetEtaGap(-1., 1.);
      cuts->SetPhiMin( 0 );
      cuts->SetPhiMax( TMath::TwoPi() );
      cuts->SetApplyRecentering(kTRUE);
      cuts->SetVZEROgainEqualizationPerRing(kFALSE);
     return cuts;
    }
~~~

#### Caveats and remarks

Using the VZERO as reference detector in a flow analysis certainly has
its benefits (such as suppressing the non-flow contribution to the
*v*<sub>*n*</sub> signal) but a few remarks have to be made

Applicability to flow analysis methods  
As the calibration affects the information that is returned by the
function

~~~{.cxx}
    void AliFlowEvent::Get2Qsub()
~~~

only flow analysis methods which call this function (and thus
use sub-events) can use the calibrated VZERO signal. Most notably, this
is the scalar product method. In combination with this, one should keep
in mind that the two VZERO detectors have different *η* coverage. For
the recent `ALICE` paper on the flow of identified particles, the scalar
product method with VZERO sub-events was used, where the two VZERO
detectors comprised the two sub-events. For more information on this,
take a look at the description of the scalar product method in
subsection [`Scalar Product`](#scalarproduct).

VZERO as RP source  
The VZERO signal should only be used as source for reference flow.
Although technically there is no objection to using the VZERO signal as
POI’s (you will probably get output) there is no guarantee that this
makes sense from a ‘physics’ viewpoint;

Tuning of the calibration  
The calibration in the LHC11h data is taken from an external class and
therefore, as far as the flow package is considered, as-is (although the
calibration can be disabled). The LHC10h calibration however is done
within the package, and can be tuned quite a bit.

Tuning the calibration is done by functions of the
`AliFlowTrackCuts` class. Some of these functions apply to both LHC10h
and LHC11h data but can have slightly different effects:

~~~{.cxx}
      // to either enable or disable the recentering 
      // (for 11h this will mean that no calibration is performed,
      // for 10h it will result in only doing a re-weighting)
      void SetApplyRecentering(Bool_t r)
      // to enable a per-ring instead of per-disc gain equalization (=re-weighting)
      // (for 11h this has no effect)
      void SetVZEROgainEqualizationPerRing(Bool_t s)   
      // exclude vzero rings: 0 through 7 can be excluded by calling this setter multiple times
      // 0 corresponds to segment ID 0 through 7, etc
      // disabled vzero rings get weight 0
      // with this function you can omit information from entire vzero rings
      // might be useful for runs where there is a bad signal in one of the tiles
      // (sometimes referred to as 'clipping')
      void SetUseVZERORing(Int_t i, Bool_t u)
~~~

Be warned however: the databases which are read during the calibration
however are tuned to the combination of re-weighting of all rings
with re-centering. Changing this combination might lead to biases in the
**Q** vector distribution, so: playing with the calibration settings
might be interesting for e.g. evaluating systematic uncertainties, but
keep an eye on the control histograms!

<a name="trackweights></a>
#### Track weights

When it is a-priori know that a track sample needs to be
weighted in φ, η or p<sub>T</sub> (e.g. to correct for a
non-uniform acceptance bias in azimuth by using weight which are
inversely proportional to the azimuthal track distribution) histograms
with weight distributions can be supplied to the flow package. The
weights are supplied to flow analysis tasks, which then apply these
weights by passing them to the `Q` vector calculation functions which
are printed in the previous subsection.

The weights have to be supplied as `TH1F` objects (or objects which can
be dynamically cast to a `TH1F` encapsulated in `TList`. The histograms
have to have specific names: `phi_weights` for φ weights, `pt_weights`
for p<sub>T</sub> weights and `eta_weights` for η weights. The
binning of the histograms is not important, as long as bins are of equal
width. The weights are disabled by default and have to be passed to
specific flow analysis tasks (as not all tasks support weights) via

~~~{.cxx}
    // set weight list
    AliFlowAnalysisWith*::SetWeightsList(TList* const) 
    // toggle phi weights on / off
    AliFlowAnalysisWith*::SetUsePhiWeights(Bool_t const)
    // toggle eta weighs on / off
    AliFlowAnalysisWith*::SetUseEtaWeights(Bool_t const)
    // toggle pt weights on / off
    AliFlowAnalysisWith*::SetUsePtWeights(Bool_t const)
~~~

and are applied to total `Q` vectors and sub-event `Q` vectors.

The tasks which support weights are

-   AliFlowAnalysisWithNestedLoops

-   AliFlowAnalysisWithScalarProduct

-   AliFlowAnalysisWithQCumulants

-   AliFlowAnalysisTemplate

-   AliFlowAnalysisWithFittingQDistribution

-   AliFlowAnalysisWithCumulants

-   AliFlowAnalysisWithMixedHarmonics

For details on how the weighting is implemented (and defined) the user
is referred to the specific `Q` vector evaluation functions given in the
previous subsection.

#### AliFlowCommonConstants - The Common Constants class

All flow analysis use a common output container to store their
histograms. To set the configuration for the histograms in these
containers - e.g. the p<sub>T</sub> ranges of histograms, the number
of bins, etc, etc - all flow analysis methods initialize their output
containers using variables from a static (global) instance of the
`AliFlowCommonConstants` class. This object, which can be obtained via
the a static function

~~~{.cxx}
    static AliFlowCommonConstants* GetMaster(); 
~~~

can be tuned to the user’s liking by requesting a pointer to it via the
static access method, and using the available setter functions, e.g. the
following

~~~{.cxx}
    AliFlowCommonConstants* cc = AliFlowCommonConstants::GetMaster();
    cc->SetNbinsPt(100);
    cc->SetPtMin(0);
    cc->SetPtMax(10); 
~~~

will result in an analysis which is performed in 100 *p*<sub>*t*</sub>
bins of 0.1 GeV/*c* width. The full set of histogram sizes and limits
that can be set is

~~~{.cxx}
     //histogram sizes
      Int_t  fNbinsMult; // histogram size
      Int_t  fNbinsPt;   // histogram size
      Int_t  fNbinsPhi;  // histogram size
      Int_t  fNbinsEta;  // histogram size
      Int_t  fNbinsQ;    // histogram size
      Int_t  fNbinsMass; // histogram size
     
      // Histograms limits
      Double_t  fMultMin;  // histogram limit 
      Double_t  fMultMax;  // histogram limit
      Double_t  fPtMin;    // histogram limit
      Double_t  fPtMax;    // histogram limit
      Double_t  fPhiMin;     // histogram limit
      Double_t  fPhiMax;   // histogram limit
      Double_t  fEtaMin;     // histogram limit
      Double_t  fEtaMax;     // histogram limit
      Double_t  fQMin;     // histogram limit
      Double_t  fQMax;     // histogram limit
      Double_t  fMassMin;  // histogram limit 
      Double_t  fMassMax;  // histogram limit
      Double_t  fHistWeightvsPhiMin; // histogram limit
      Double_t  fHistWeightvsPhiMax; // histogram limit
~~~

via the setters

~~~{.cxx}
        void SetNbinsMult( Int_t i ) { fNbinsMult = i; }
      void SetNbinsPt( Int_t i )   { fNbinsPt = i; }
      void SetNbinsPhi( Int_t i )  { fNbinsPhi = i; }
      void SetNbinsEta( Int_t i )  { fNbinsEta = i; }
      void SetNbinsQ( Int_t i )    { fNbinsQ = i; }
      void SetNbinsMass( Int_t i ) { fNbinsMass = i; }
      void SetMultMin( Double_t i ) { fMultMin = i; }
      void SetMultMax( Double_t i ) { fMultMax = i; }
      void SetPtMin( Double_t i )   { fPtMin = i; }
      void SetPtMax( Double_t i )   { fPtMax = i; }
      void SetPhiMin( Double_t i )  { fPhiMin = i; }
      void SetPhiMax( Double_t i )  { fPhiMax = i; }
      void SetEtaMin( Double_t i )  { fEtaMin = i; }
      void SetEtaMax( Double_t i )  { fEtaMax = i; }
      void SetQMin( Double_t i )    { fQMin = i; }
      void SetQMax( Double_t i )    { fQMax = i; }
      void SetMassMin( Double_t i )    { fMassMin = i; }
      void SetMassMax( Double_t i )    { fMassMax = i; }
      void SetHistWeightvsPhiMax( Double_t d ) {fHistWeightvsPhiMax=d;}
      void SetHistWeightvsPhiMin( Double_t d ) {fHistWeightvsPhiMin=d;}
~~~

Note that the common constants object is `static`, meaning that, within
a process (e.g. an analysis train) just *one* instance of the object is
created. The histogram limits and sizes that are set via the common
constants object therefore affect *all* histograms within an analysis
chain.

#### AliFlowCommonHist and AliFlowCommonHistResults - details

Both the `AliFlowCommonHist` and `AliFlowCommonHistResults` classes do
not only contain (pointers to) histograms and profiles, but also have a
collection of ‘getters’[14] which you can use to retrieve histograms of
profiles using the `ROOT` command line in stead of the `TBrowser`, which
may come in handy when one needs to read the output of the flow analysis
tasks in a macro.

Using the output file that was generated in the example given in the
previous sections of this chapter, reading the objects of the common
histogram classes is done in the following way. First, start an
`(Ali)ROOT` session, and load the prerequisite libraries,

~~~{.cxx}
    gSystem->Load("libPWGflowBase");
~~~

Then, open the analysis file and grab the common histogram objects

~~~{.cxx}
    // open the file
    TFile f("AnalysisResults.root");
    // get the qc analysis output directory
    TDirectoryFile* dir = (TDirectoryFile*)f.Get("outputQCanalysis");
    // and retrieve the output list of the analysis
    TList* outputList = (TList*)dir->Get("cobjQC")
~~~

The `TList` that you have just obtained holds not only the common
histogram objects, but can also hold additional information that has
been added to the analysis output by a specific flow analysis task. To
read the entire content of the `TList`, you can type

~~~{.cxx}
    outputList->ls();
~~~

However, in this example we want to retrieve the common histogram
objects. To do so, type

~~~{.cxx}
    // get common histogram object from the TList
    AliFlowCommonHist* commonHist = (AliFlowCommonHist*)outputList->FindObject("AliFlowCommonHistQC");
    // get the results for the 2 particle cumulant from the TList
    AliFlowCommonHistResults* commonHistResults2 = (AliFlowCommonHistResults*)outputList->FindObject("AliFlowCommonHistResults2ndOrderQC");
~~~

Once you have retrieved the pointers to the `AliFlowCommonHist` or
`AliFlowCommonHistResults` objects, you can use the getters to retrieve
a histogram. To e.g. draw the *η* distribution of POI’s, type

~~~{.cxx}
     commonHist->GetHistEtaPOI()->Draw();
~~~

The following getters are available in `AliFlowCommonHist`

~~~{.cxx}
      Double_t GetEntriesInPtBinRP(Int_t iBin);   //gets entries from fHistPtRP
      Double_t GetEntriesInPtBinPOI(Int_t iBin);  //gets entries from fHistPtPOI
      Double_t GetEntriesInEtaBinRP(Int_t iBin);  //gets entries from fHistEtaRP
      Double_t GetEntriesInEtaBinPOI(Int_t iBin); //gets entries from fHistEtaPOI
      Double_t GetMeanPt(Int_t iBin);             //gets the mean pt for this bin from fHistProMeanPtperBin   
      TH1F*     GetHistMultRP()          {return fHistMultRP; } ;  
      TH1F*     GetHistMultPOI()         {return fHistMultPOI; } ; 
      TH2F*     GetHistMultPOIvsRP()     {return fHistMultPOIvsRP; } ;
      TH1F*     GetHistPtRP()            {return fHistPtRP; } ;  
      TH1F*     GetHistPtPOI()           {return fHistPtPOI; } ;
      TH1F*     GetHistPtSub0()          {return fHistPtSub0; } ;
      TH1F*     GetHistPtSub1()          {return fHistPtSub1; } ;
      TH1F*     GetHistPhiRP()           {return fHistPhiRP; } ;  
      TH1F*     GetHistPhiPOI()          {return fHistPhiPOI; } ;  
      TH1F*     GetHistPhiSub0()         {return fHistPhiSub0; } ; 
      TH1F*     GetHistPhiSub1()         {return fHistPhiSub1; } ; 
      TH1F*     GetHistEtaRP()           {return fHistEtaRP; } ;  
      TH1F*     GetHistEtaPOI()          {return fHistEtaPOI;  } ;  
      TH1F*     GetHistEtaSub0()         {return fHistEtaSub0;  } ; 
      TH1F*     GetHistEtaSub1()         {return fHistEtaSub1;  } ; 
      TH2F*     GetHistPhiEtaRP()        {return fHistPhiEtaRP;  } ; 
      TH2F*     GetHistPhiEtaPOI()       {return fHistPhiEtaPOI;  } ; 
      TProfile* GetHistProMeanPtperBin() {return fHistProMeanPtperBin; } ;

#### Afterburner

To e.g. test your analysis setup, an ‘afterburner’ can be called which
adds user-defined flow to (isotropic) events. Two afterburner techniques
are implemented.

##### Differential *v*<sub>2</sub>  

The first technique injects differential *v*<sub>2</sub> into events,
using the following steps: As a starting point, an isotropic
distribution of tracks is used
$$\\frac{dN}{d\\varphi\_0} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi}.$$
 Adding a periodic azimuthal modulation, this is translated to
$$\\frac{dN}{d\\varphi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left( 1 + v\_2 \\cos \\left\[ 2 \\left( \\varphi - \\Psi \\right) \\right\] \\right)$$
 which can be re-written as
$$\\frac{dN}{d\\varphi} = \\frac{dN}{d\\varphi\_0}\\frac{d\\varphi\_0}{d\\varphi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{d\\varphi\_0}{d\\varphi}$$
 so that for each track the following equation can be solved by
Newton-Raphson iteration
$$\\varphi = \\varphi_0 - v\_2 \\sin \\left\[ 2 \\left( \\varphi - \\Psi \\right) \\right\]$$

##### Integrated v<sub>n</sub>  

The second option is adding integrated v<sub>n</sub> by sampling the
azimuthal distribution of an event from a Fourier series
$$\\frac{dN}{d\\varphi} \\propto 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum\_n v\_n \\left( n \\Delta \\varphi \\right).$$

In the ‘quick start’ of this manual you have already see how you can
generate flow events with a certain *v*<sub>*n*</sub> value by
generating flow events by hand. The afterburner routine can also be
called from the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` via the functions

~~~{.cxx}
     // setters for adding by hand flow values (afterburner)
     
     // toggle the afterburner on / off
      void SetAfterburnerOn(Bool_t b=kTRUE) {fAfterburnerOn=b;}
     // set differential v2 via a TF1  
      void SetPtDifferentialV2( TF1 *gPtV2) {fDifferentialV2 = gPtV2;}
      // set integrated flow (used when the gPtV2 = NULL)
      void SetFlow( Double_t v1, Double_t v2, Double_t v3=0.0, Double_t v4=0.0, Double_t v5=0.0)
                   {fV1=v1;fV2=v2;fV3=v3;fV4=v4;fV5=v5;}
~~~

To introduce non-flow effects to using the afterburner, tracks can be
cloned. To clone, for each event, a given number *n* of tracks, enable
the afterburner and call

~~~{.cxx}
      void SetNonFlowNumberOfTrackClones(Int_t n) {fNonFlowNumberOfTrackClones=n;}
~~~

Effectively this will result in *n* tracks appearing twice in the track
sample, mimicking the effects of e.g. resonance decays of track
splitting on *v*<sub>*n*</sub>.

### Relevant pieces of code

The best way of getting familiar with the flow package is perhaps
browsing the source code, but it can be difficult to find a good
starting point for this. Two relevant pieces of code have been selected
here which are at the heart of the flow package:

1.  The AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent::UserExec() function, which is called
    for each event that enters an analysis train;

2.  AliFlowEvent::Fill(), which selects POI’s and RP’s following the
    track selection criteria and fills the flow event which is passed to
    the analysis methods. The functions are shortened and simplified and
    provided with additional lines of comments.

#### AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent::UserExec()

This function is called for each event.

~~~{.cxx}
    void AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent::UserExec(Option_t *)
    {
      // Main loop
      // Called for each event
      //delete fFlowEvent;
      AliMCEvent*  mcEvent = MCEvent();                              // from TaskSE
      AliESDEvent* myESD = dynamic_cast<AliESDEvent*>(InputEvent()); // from TaskSE
      AliAODEvent* myAOD = dynamic_cast<AliAODEvent*>(InputEvent()); // from TaskSE

      // the rp and poi cuts will be used to fill the flow event
      // so they have to be defined here
      if (!(fCutsRP&&fCutsPOI&&fCutsEvent))
      {
        AliError("cuts not set");
        return;
      }

      //DEFAULT - automatically takes care of everything
      // the flow package will determine the datatype that you are using
      if (fAnalysisType == "AUTOMATIC")
      {
        //check event cuts
        if (InputEvent() && !fCutsEvent->IsSelected(InputEvent(),MCEvent())) 
          return;

        //first attach all possible information to the cuts
        // the track cuts will make the track selection, so they
        // have to be supplied with the current event
        // the mc event is NULL unless it is retrieved by AliAnalysisTaskSE   
        fCutsRP->SetEvent( InputEvent(), MCEvent() );  //attach event
        fCutsPOI->SetEvent( InputEvent(), MCEvent() );

        //then make the event
        // this function will fill the flow event with selected poi's and rp's
        // the implementation is printed below
        fFlowEvent->Fill( fCutsRP, fCutsPOI );

        // pass some event info to the flow event
        fFlowEvent->SetReferenceMultiplicity(fCutsEvent->GetReferenceMultiplicity(InputEvent(),mcEvent));
        fFlowEvent->SetCentrality(fCutsEvent->GetCentrality(InputEvent(),mcEvent));
        if (mcEvent && mcEvent->GenEventHeader()) fFlowEvent->SetMCReactionPlaneAngle(mcEvent);
      }

      // a lot of code is omitted here //

      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
      ///////////////////////////AFTERBURNER
      if (fAfterburnerOn)
      {
        //if reaction plane not set from elsewhere randomize it before adding flow
        if (!fFlowEvent->IsSetMCReactionPlaneAngle())
          fFlowEvent->SetMCReactionPlaneAngle(gRandom->Uniform(0.0,TMath::TwoPi()));

        if(fDifferentialV2)
          fFlowEvent->AddV2(fDifferentialV2);
        else 
          fFlowEvent->AddFlow(fV1,fV2,fV3,fV4,fV5);     //add flow
        fFlowEvent->CloneTracks(fNonFlowNumberOfTrackClones); //add nonflow by cloning tracks
      }
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

      //tag subEvents
      // some flow analysis methods (such as the scalar product) 
      // use sub-events. by calling this function, all tracks in the 
      // flow event are tagged as belonging to either sub-event a or b
      fFlowEvent->TagSubeventsInEta(fMinA,fMaxA,fMinB,fMaxB);
~~~

<a name="fill"></a>
#### AliFlowEvent::Fill()

This function fills the flow event with `AliFlowSimpleTracks`. One
important thing to notice here, is that both POI’s and RP’s are stored
in a common array of flow tracks, internally only referred to as POI’s.
What distinguishes the POI’s and RP’s is their *type*: RP’s are stored
as type 0 POI’s, and POI’s are stored as non-zero type POI’s (where
nonzero means 1, 2, 3 ...).

~~~{.cxx}
    //-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    void AliFlowEvent::Fill( AliFlowTrackCuts* rpCuts,
                             AliFlowTrackCuts* poiCuts )

      //Fills the event from a vevent: AliESDEvent,AliAODEvent,AliMCEvent
      //the input data needs to be attached to the cuts
      //we have two cases, if we're cutting the same collection of tracks
      //(same param type) then we can have tracks that are both rp and poi
      //in the other case we want to have two exclusive sets of rps and pois
      //e.g. one tracklets, the other PMD or global - USER IS RESPOSIBLE
      //FOR MAKING SURE THEY DONT OVERLAP OR ELSE THE SAME PARTICLE WILL BE
      //TAKEN TWICE

      // remove the previous event
      ClearFast();
      if (!rpCuts || !poiCuts) return;
      // check the source of rp's
      AliFlowTrackCuts::trackParameterType sourceRP = rpCuts->GetParamType();
      // and ditto for the poi's
      AliFlowTrackCuts::trackParameterType sourcePOI = poiCuts->GetParamType();
      
      AliFlowTrack* pTrack=NULL;

      // and set the calibration parameters

              fApplyRecentering = -1;
          }
          // note: this flag is used in the overloaded implementation of Get2Qsub()
          // and tells the function to use as Qsub vectors the recentered Q-vectors
          // from the VZERO oadb file or from the event header
      }

### Some words on the ALICE analysis framework

Many of the classes which are described in the previous section deal
with `ALICE` data (e.g. event and track selection). Generally, this data
is analyzed in `ALICE` analysis framework. This framework is setup in
the following way

1.  An analysis manager `analysis manager` is created;

2.  The manager is connected to a source of input data (this can be data
    that is stored on your local machine, but more often data comes in
    the form of `.xml` files which point to data on `GRID` storage
    elements);

3.  A number of analysis tasks is initialized, configured, and added to
    the analysis manager (so that you construct an ‘analysis train’);

4.  The analysis is performed, which in effect means that the manager
    reads an event, passes it to the analysis tasks (who analyze it
    sequentially), and repeats this until all events are read. In this
    way, an event can be analyzed by many tasks whilst reading it from
    file just once;

5.  The analysis outputs are gathered by the manager and written to an
    output file.

In this case of the flow package, the most common way of using this
framework is

-   Creating flow events using the dedicated flow event task
    `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent`;

-   Analyzing these events using the `AliROOT` interface to the generic
    flow analysis tasks.

#### AliAnalysisTaskSE

All analysis tasks that are called by the analysis manager have to be
derived from a common class, the `AliAnalysisTaskSE`[15] (where the
suffix ‘SE’ stands for ‘single event’). `AliAnalysisTaskSE` has a few
virtual functions which can be called in user tasks by the analysis
manager at specific times. Most notably these are

UserCreateOutputObjects  
This function is called *before* the analysis starts;

UserExec  
This function is called for each event;

Terminate  
Called at the end of the analysis (after the last event has
been processed).

So, why is this important for the flow package? As said, the analysis
manager can only handle tasks that derive from `AliAnalysisTaskSE`.
Therefore, all flow analysis in the flow package consist of *two*
classes:

AliAnalysisTask \*   
These can be found in the ‘tasks’ directory of the flow package and are
derived of `AliAnalysisTaskSE`. These classes interface with `AliROOT`;

AliFlowAnalysisWith \*   
These can be found in the ‘base’ folder of the flow package and perform
the actual flow analysis.

In chapter [`On The Fly`](#onthefly) of this manual, you have seen that, using
just the `AliFlowAnalysisWith\ast` class, a flow analysis basically
follows the path

1.  `Init()`: called once to initialize the task and histograms;

2.  `Make()`: called for each event, does the analysis;

3.  `Finish()`: wrap up the analysis.

When doing the analysis in the analysis framework, you will not use the
`AliFlowAnalysisWith\*` class, but instead use the
`AliAnalysisTask\*` which calls the `AliFlowAnalysisWith\*` class
for you via the calls from `AliAnalysisTaskSE`. To be more specific:

1.  `Init()` is called in `UserCreateOutputObjects()`;

2.  `Make()` is called in `UserExec()`;

3.  `Finish()` is called in `Terminate()`.

All of this may still seem a bit abstract at this point, but in
principle you now know all you need to know about the structure of the
flow package. It is recommended however that you take a look at the
example in [`Examples`](#examples), to get a step-by-step explanation of how
these things work in the real world.

#### Analysys on grid: redoFinish.C

As explained in [`On The Fly`](#onthefly) and in the previous subsection, a flow
analysis is finished by a call to `Finish()`. Although the exact
implementation of `Finish()` is different for each flow analysis method,
the general principle method in most methods is that calculations on
event-averaged values are performed to end up with a final value for an
observable.

When an analysis is run in parallel on many nodes (e.g. when running on
`GRID`) the output of the flow analysis tasks in `AnalysisResults.root`
is typically wrong, as merging files via `ROOT’s` `TFileMerger` will
trivially sum up results in all histograms.

The `redoFinish.C`[16] macro re-evaluates all output that cannot
trivially be merged and re-calls the `Finish()` method. To use
`redoFinish.C`, make sure your analysis output file is called
`mergedAnalysisResults.root` and simply run the macro

~~~{.cxx}
    .L redoFinish.C
    redoFinish(); 
~~~

`redoFinish.C` will produce a new `AnalysisResults.root` file with the
corrected results by calling the `::Finish()` function on all known
output structures in the `mergedAnalysisResults.root` file. Additionally
`redoFinish.C` can be used to repeat the call to `::Finish()` with
different settings, which might alter the outcome of the flow analysis
(e.g. use a different strategy to correct for non-uniform acceptance).

The macro itself is well documented and lists several options that are
available at the time of running:

~~~{.cxx}
    // Macro redoFinish.C is typically used after the merging macros (mergeOutput.C or
    // mergeOutputOnGrid.C) have been used to produce the merged, large statistics
    // file of flow analysis. Results stored in merged file are WRONG because after
    // merging the results from small statistics files are trivially summed up in all
    // histograms. This is taken into account and corrected for with macro redoFinish.C.
    // Another typical use of the macro redoFinish.C is to repeat the call to Finish()
    // in all classes, but with different values of some settings which might modify
    // the final results (Example: redo the Finish() and apply correction for detector
    // effects in QC code because by default this correction is switched off).

    // Name of the merged, large statistics file obtained with the merging macros:
    TString mergedFileName = "mergedAnalysisResults.root";
    // Final output file name holding correct final results for large statistics sample:
    TString outputFileName = "AnalysisResults.root";

    Bool_t bApplyCorrectionForNUA = kFALSE; // apply correction for non-uniform acceptance
    Bool_t bApplyCorrectionForNUAVsM = kFALSE; // apply correction for non-uniform acceptance in each multiplicity bin independently
    Bool_t bPropagateErrorAlsoFromNIT = kFALSE; // propagate error also from non-isotropic terms
    Bool_t bMinimumBiasReferenceFlow = kTRUE; // store in CRH for reference flow the result obtained wihout rebinning in multiplicity (kTRUE)
    Bool_t checkForCommonHistResults = kTRUE; // check explicitely if the TList AliFlowCommonHistResults is available in the output
~~~

Flow analysis output is recognized by keywords in output list names
(e.g. a Q-cumulant output needs to have the letters ‘QC’ somewhere in
the name to be recognized).

When your analysis output is in the form of a merged file, *always* run
`redoFinish.C` to get your results!

<a name="examples"></a>
### Example: π<sup> ± </sup> v<sub>n</sub>

As an example of how to do a flow analysis using the flow package within
the `AliROOT` analysis framework, this section will guide you through
the process of measuring π<sup> ± </sup> v<sub>2</sub>,
v<sub>3</sub> and v<sub>4</sub> step-by-step, using the Q-vector
cumulant flow analysis method.

Generally, doing an analysis in the `AliROOT` is a ‘two-file process’,
where one runs a run.C script in `AliROOT` (colloquially referred to as
‘steering macro’), which sets up the analysis framework and takes care
of the interface to the analysis `GRID`, and calls an `AddTask\*.C`
macro which in turn creates and configures instances of the relevant
analysis tasks. In this example, the distinction will not be so clear,
but mentioned in the text. In practice of course, you would copy these
steps into macros and launch the macros from the `AliROOT` command line
when doing analysis. We will not run this test on `GRID`, but assume
that you have some `AliAOD.root` files available on your local system.
Note that this example is a guideline, there are many ways leading to
Rome, and many ways of setting up an analysis. Some of the variables
that are set in the code examples below are actually also set by
default. This may seem a little bit redundant, but it is done to make
the reader aware of the fact that they exist.

A script which contains all the steps described below and should work
‘out-of-the-box’ can be found at
`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWGCF/FLOW/Documentation/examples/manual/runFlowOnDataExample.C`.

Preparing the session  
First, we need to prepare the framework and root session (these steps
would go into your run.C macro). Launch `AliROOT` and load the necessary
libraries

~~~{.cxx}
      // load libraries
      gSystem->Load("libPWGflowTasks.so"); 
~~~

Creating the manager and connecting input data  
Create an analysis manager and create a `TChain` which we will point to
the data you have stored locally on your machine

~~~{.cxx}
      // create the analysis manager
      AliAnalysisManager* mgr = new AliAnalysisManager("MyManager");
      // create a tchain which will point to an aod tree
      TChain* chain = new TChain("aodTree");
      // add a few files to the chain
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0003/AliAOD.root");
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0003/AliAOD.root");
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0004/AliAOD.root");
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0005/AliAOD.root");
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0006/AliAOD.root");
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0007/AliAOD.root");
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0008/AliAOD.root");
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0009/AliAOD.root");
      chain->Add("/home/rbertens/Documents/CERN/ALICE_DATA/data/2010/LHC10h/000139510/ESDs/pass2/AOD086/0010/AliAOD.root");
      // create an input handler
      AliVEventHandler* inputH = new AliAODInputHandler();
      // and connect it to the manager
      mgr->SetInputEventHandler(inputH);
~~~

Great, at this point we have created an analysis manager, which will
read events from a chain of AliAOD.root files.

The next step will be adding specific analyses to the analysis manager.
This is usually done by calling an `AddTask\ast.C` macro, which creates
instances of analysis tasks, connects input (events from the
analysis manager) to these tasks, and then connects output from the task
back to the analysis manager (which will take care of writing the
analysis to a common output file). These next steps show what would be
in your `AddTask\ast.C` macro.

The heart of our flow analysis will be the flow event. To fill a flow
event from the input AOD events, we will use the
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` class. The AOD input events have to be
supplied by the analysis manager, so first things first, retrieve the
manager to which you will connect your flow analysis tasks[17]:

~~~{.cxx}
      // the manager is static, so get the existing manager via the static method
      AliAnalysisManager *mgr = AliAnalysisManager::GetAnalysisManager();
      if (!mgr) {
          printf("No analysis manager to connect to!\n");
          return NULL;
      }
            
      // just to see if all went well, check if the input event handler has been connected
      if (!mgr->GetInputEventHandler()) {
          printf("This task requires an input event handler!\n");
          return NULL;
        }
~~~

Setting up the flow event task  
The manager and input data are present, so we can create the flow event
task and do some basic configuration

~~~{.cxx}
      // create instance of the class. because possible qa plots are added in a second ouptut slot,
      // the flow analysis task must know if you want to save qa plots at the time of class construction
      Bool_t doQA = kTRUE;
      // craete instance of the class
      AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent* taskFE = new AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent("FlowEventTask", "", doQA);
      // add the task to the manager
      mgr->AddTask(taskFE);
      // set the trigger selection
      taskFE->SelectCollisionCandidates(AliVEvent::kMB);
~~~

Note that in the last step you have set the trigger configuration.
Always make sure that you run on a trigger that makes sense for
your analysis. A general remark is that the non-uniform acceptance
correction methods that are implemented in the flow package, assume a
flat **Q** vector distribution. Specific triggers (e.g. EMCal triggers)
result in a **Q** vector bias which should *not* be corrected as they
invalidate that assumption[18].

In addition to the trigger selection, one might want to do some more
event selection. The flow package has a common event selection class,
which we will add to your flow event

~~~{.cxx}
      // define the event cuts object
      AliFlowEventCuts* cutsEvent = new AliFlowEventCuts("EventCuts");
      // configure some event cuts, starting with centrality
      cutsEvent->SetCentralityPercentileRange(20., 30.);
      // method used for centrality determination
      cutsEvent->SetCentralityPercentileMethod(AliFlowEventCuts::kV0);
      // vertex-z cut
      cutsEvent->SetPrimaryVertexZrange(-10.,10.);
      // enable the qa plots
      cutsEvent->SetQA(doQA);
      // explicit multiplicity outlier cut
      cutsEvent->SetCutTPCmultiplicityOutliersAOD(kTRUE);
      cutsEvent->SetLHC10h(kTRUE);
      
      
      // and, last but not least, pass these cuts to your flow event task
      taskFE->SetCutsEvent(cutsEvent);
~~~

Track selection  
Now that the flow event task has been created and some basic
configuration has been done, it’s time to specify the POI and
RP selection. This is done by defining sets of track selection criteria
for both POI’s and RP’s: tracks in an event that pass the track
selection criteria are used as POI or RP. The track selection is defined
in `AliFlowTrackCuts` objects which are passed to the
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` task which does the actual selection based on
the passed criteria. So, let’s create some track selection objects!

Starting with the RP’s, for which we’ll just use a uniform selection of
charged tracks,

~~~{.cxx}
      //create the track cuts object using a static function of AliFlowTrackCuts
      AliFlowTrackCuts* cutsRP = AliFlowTrackCuts::GetAODTrackCutsForFilterBit(1, "RP cuts");
      // specify the pt range
      cutsRP->SetPtRange(0.2, 5.);
      // specify eta range
      cutsRP->SetEtaRange(-0.8, 0.8);
      // specify track type
      cutsRP->SetParamType(AliFlowTrackCuts::kAODFilterBit);
      // enable saving qa histograms
      cutsRP->SetQA(kTRUE);
~~~

The particles in this example of which we want to measure the
differential *v*<sub>2</sub> (the POI’s) are the charged pions. To
measure the *v*<sub>2</sub> of charged pions, one must of course
identify tracks are pions: for this we will use the
`AliFlowTrackCuts` class. First, we do the basic setup, creating the cut
object and setting some kinematic variables:

~~~{.cxx}
      //create the track cuts object using a static function of AliFlowTrackCuts
      AliFlowTrackCuts* cutsPOI = AliFlowTrackCuts::GetAODTrackCutsForFilterBit(1, "pion selection");
      // specify the pt range
      cutsPOI->SetPtRange(0.2, 5.);
      // specify eta range
      cutsPOI->SetEtaRange(-0.8, 0.8);
      // specify the track type
      cutsRP->SetParamType(AliFlowTrackCuts::kAODFilterBit);
      // enable saving qa histograms
      cutsPOI->SetQA(kTRUE);
~~~

Once this is done, the particle identification routine is defined. In
this example, the particle identification will be done using a Bayesian
approach, combining the signals from the TPC and TOF detectors.

~~~{.cxx}
      // which particle do we want to identify ?
      AliPID::EParticleType particleType=AliPID::kPion;
      // specify the pid method that we want to use  
      AliFlowTrackCuts::PIDsource sourcePID=AliFlowTrackCuts::kTOFbayesian;
      // define the probability (between 0 and 1) 
      Double_t probability = .9;
      // pass these variables to the track cut object
      cutsPOI->SetPID(particleType, sourcePID, probability);
      // the bayesian pid routine uses priors tuned to an average centrality
      cutsPOI->SetPriors(35.);
~~~

Now that the track cuts for both POI’s and RP’s are defined, we can
connect them to the flow event task,

~~~{.cxx}
      // connect the RP's to the flow event task
      taskFE->SetCutsRP(cutsRP);
      // connect the POI's to the flow event task
      taskFE->SetCutsPOI(cutsPOI);
~~~

Connecting input and output  
At this point, the event and track cuts have been set and connected to
the flow event task. The next step will be connecting the flow event
task to the analysis manager (so that it can receive input events) and
subsequently connecting the flow event task to flow analysis tasks, so
that the flow events can be analyzed by our favorite flow
analysis methods.

~~~{.cxx}
      // get the default name of the output file ("AnalysisResults.root")
      TString file = GetCommonFileName();
      // get the common input container from the analysis manager
      AliAnalysisDataContainer *cinput = mgr->GetCommonInputContainer();
       // create a data container for the output of the flow event task  
       // the output of the task is the AliFlowEventSimle class which will
       // be passed to the flow analysis tasks. note that we use a kExchangeContainer here,
       // which exchanges data between classes of the analysis chain, but is not
       // written to the output file
      AliAnalysisDataContainer *coutputFE = mgr->CreateContainer(
          "FlowEventContainer",
          AliFlowEventSimple::Class(),
          AliAnalysisManager::kExchangeContainer);
      // connect the input data to the flow event task
      mgr->ConnectInput(taskFE,0,cinput);
      // and connect the output to the flow event task
      mgr->ConnectOutput(taskFE,1,coutputFE);
      // create an additional container for the QA output of the flow event task
      // the QA histograms will be stored in a sub-folder of the output file called 'QA'
      TString taskFEQAname = file;
      taskFEQAname += ":QA";
      AliAnalysisDataContainer* coutputFEQA = mgr->CreateContainer(
          "FlowEventContainerQA",
           TList::Class(),
           AliAnalysisManager::kOutputContainer,
           taskFEQAname.Data()       
           );
      // and connect the qa output container to the flow event. 
      // this container will be written to the output file
      mgr->ConnectOutput(taskFE,2,coutputFEQA);
~~~

Flow analysis tasks  
Now that the flow event task is connected to input data, the flow
analysis tasks can be set up:

~~~{.cxx}
      // declare necessary pointers
      AliAnalysisDataContainer *coutputQC[3];
      AliAnalysisTaskQCumulants *taskQC[3];

      // the tasks will be created and added to the manager in a loop
      for(Int_t i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          // create the flow analysis tasks
          taskQC[i] = new AliAnalysisTaskQCumulants(Form("TaskQCumulants_n=%i", i+2));
          // set thei triggers 
          taskQC[i]->SelectCollisionCandidates(AliVEvent::kMB);
          // and set the correct harmonic n
          taskQC[i]->SetHarmonic(i+2);

          // connect the task to the analysis manager
          mgr->AddTask(taskQC[i]);

          // create and connect the output containers
          TString outputQC = file;
          // create a sub-folder in the output file for each flow analysis task's output
          outputQC += Form(":QC_output_for_n=%i", i+2);
          /// create the output containers
          coutputQC[i] = mgr->CreateContainer(
              outputQC.Data(),
              TList::Class(),
              AliAnalysisManager::kOutputContainer,
              outputQC);
          // connect the output of the flow event task to the flow analysis task
          mgr->ConnectInput(taskQC[i], 0, coutputFE);
          // and connect the output of the flow analysis task to the output container
          // which will be written to the output file
          mgr->ConnectOutput(taskQC[i], 1, coutputQC[i]);
      }
~~~

Launching the analysis  
With this, the `AddTask\ast.C` is concluded. The only thing that is left
to do, is (from the `run.C` macro) see if all tasks and containers are
properly connected and initialized and launch the analysis locally:

~~~{.cxx}
      // check if we can initialize the manager
      if(!mgr->InitAnalysis()) return;   
      // print the status of the manager to screen 
      mgr->PrintStatus();
      // print to screen how the analysis is progressing
      mgr->SetUseProgressBar(1, 25);
      // start the analysis locally, reading the events from the tchain
      mgr->StartAnalysis("local", chain);
~~~

Flow analysis in ROOT: Using TTree’s and TNTuples
-------------------------------------------------

As stated at the beginning of this chapter, every flow analysis in the
flow package starts by filling the flow event. The flow event base
class, `AliFlowEventSimple`, is a class in `libPWGflowBase` which has no
dependencies other than some `ROOT` libraries; the same is true for the
implementation of the flow analysis methods. This means that when you do
not need the `AliROOT` interface for e.g. track and event selection, the
flow package can be used by just invoking the `libPWGflowBase.so`
library in `ROOT`[19]. The steps that are necessary to use the flow
package in a bare `ROOT` environment are similar to those explained in
chapter [`On The Fly`](#onthefly), with the exception that instead of generating
events on-the-fly, we need to fill the flow event with information from
the source of data which we want to analyze. In the next two subsections
we will take a look at how to do a flow analysis on generic data in just
`ROOT`. To start, pseudo-code of how to setup an analysis on a `TTree`
will filled with particles be given. This example can be used as a
starting point for running the flow package on any kind of input data.
After this, we will work through an example of reading and analyzing
`STAR` data. The last subsection of this chapter will point you to a
fully working starting point for doing flow analysis on `TTree`’s, which
firstly converts data to a `TTree` and after this reads the stored
`TTree` from file and performs flow analysis in it in `ROOT`.

### A custom class derived from AliFlowEventSimple

In this example, an analysis on a `TTree` is performed by deriving a
class from the flow event class , `MyFlowEvent`, which can read a
specific input format (in this case a branch`TTree!branch` of a `TTree`)
and fills the flow event from this input. Of course you can design your
task in a different way, but in this section we will stick to that
example. Note that the following suggestions are all written in
pseudo-code, so copy-pasting it will lead to nothing ...

Let’s start with writing an an event loop. In this example the
assumption is made that you have a `TTree` with events, called ‘myTree’,
which contains a branch holding a `TClonesArray` of ‘myParticle’
objects, which contain kinematic information. The ‘myParticle’ class
could look a bit like

~~~{.cxx}
    class myParticle : public TObject
    {
    public:
            myParticle(Float_t eta, Float_t phi, Float_t pt, Int_t charge) : fEta(eta), fPhi(phi), fpT(pt), fCharge(charge) {  }
        ~myParticle() {}
        virtual Double_t P()                const { return fp; }
        virtual Double_t Pt()               const { return fpT; }
        virtual Double_t Phi()              const { return fPhi; }
        virtual Double_t Eta()              const { return fEta; }
        virtual Int_t Charge()              const { return fCharge; }
    private:
        Float_t                             fEta;      // eta
        Float_t                             fPhi;      // phi
        Float_t                             fpT;       // pT
        Int_t                               fCharge;   // charge
        ClassDef(myParticle, 1); // example class
    };
~~~

Note that the members of this class (*p*<sub>*t*</sub>, *η*, *φ*,
charge) are all the information that an `AliFlowTrackSimple` needs to
hold.

In the event loop, we’ll retrieve the track array from the `TTree` and
pass it to your derived flow event class. As we have seen in earlier
examples, tracks in a flow event are classified as POI’s or RP’s via
track cuts objects. We’ll initialize these classes as well.

~~~{.cxx}
      // first, define a set of simple cuts (the kinematic cuts)
      // which will define our poi and rp selection
      AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts *cutsRP = new AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts();
      AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts *cutsPOI = new AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts();
      cutsPOI->SetPtMin(0.2);
      cutsPOI->SetPtMax(2.0);
      // get number of entries from your ttree
      Int_t nEvents = myTree->GetEntries();
      // loop over all entries
      for(Int_t i = 0; i < nEvents; i++) {
          // get the track array from the ttree
          TClonesArray* particleArray = 0x0;
          // get the branch address by name
          myTree->SetBranchAddress("myParticles", &particleArray);
          // switch to the tree's i-th entry
          myTree->GetEntry(i);
          // now we do some magic: with a dedicated inherited class
          // we construct a flow event from your ttree
          AliFlowEventSimple* flowEvent = new MyFlowEvent(particleArray, cutsPOI, cutsRP);
          // and from here we know how to proceed: connect the flow event
          // to the flow analysis classes, and do the analysis
          qc->Make(flowEvent);
          // memory management
          delete flowEvent;
          }
      qc->Finish();
      }
~~~

So what is ‘the magic’? This is filling your flow event from the
`TTree`. As we have seen in the previous sections, filling means that
need to select our tracks, tag them as POI’s and RP’s, and add them to
the flow event. Our derived class, AliFlowEventSimple::MyFlowEvent will
take care of this. A possible constructor for this class, which performs
the ‘magic’, could look like the following piece of pseudo-code:

~~~{.cxx}
    // class constructor of an example class which reads a ttree, 
    // selects poi's and rp's and fills a flow event. 
    // this class is derived from the flow event simple class
    // and therefore can be passed to the flow analysis methods

    // we'll feed to class with your custom particles, 
    // so this include will be necessary
    #include myParticle.h

    // this is the class constructor
    MyFlowEvent::MyFlowEvent(
        // start with the input tracks
        TClonesArray* particleArray,
        // and pass the poi and rp cuts
        const AliStarTrackCuts* cutsRP,
        const AliStarTrackCuts* cutsPOI) :
      // derived from AliFlowEventSimple, initialized to hold a certain number of 
      // tracks
      AliFlowEventSimple(particleArray->GetEntries())
    {
      // the next step will be filling the flow event
      // with POI's and RP's according to our 
      // POI and RP cuts  
      
      for (Int_t i = 0; i < particleArray->GetEntries(); i++)
      {
        // get a particle from the particle array
        const myParticle* part = static_cast<myParticle*>particleArray->At(i);
        if (!myParticle) continue;
        
        // build flow track simple (for the flow event)
        AliFlowTrackSimple* flowtrack = new AliFlowTrackSimple();
        // copy the kinematic information from the star track
        flowtrack->SetPhi(part->Phi());
        flowtrack->SetEta(part->Eta());
        flowtrack->SetPt(part->Pt());
        flowtrack->SetCharge(part->Charge());
        // see if the track is a reference track
        if (cutsRP)
        {
          Bool_t pass = rpCuts->PassesCuts(flowtrack);
          flowtrack->TagRP(pass); //tag RPs
          if (pass) IncrementNumberOfPOIs(0);
        }
        // see if the track is a particle of interest
        if (poiCuts)
        {
          flowtrack->TagPOI(poiCuts->PassesCuts(flowtrack));
        }
        // add the track to the flow event
        AddTrack(flowtrack);
      }
    }
~~~

That’s it! Following (variations on) these steps, you’ll be able to
connect any type of input data to the flow package. Note that compiling
the scripts in which you define these steps will be much faster than
running your code in the interpreter mode of `ROOT`. The next subsection
will show these steps in action in the for of a flow analysis on `STAR`
data.

### A realistic example: flow package analysis on STAR data

The following section will show you how to use non-`ALICE` data in a
realistic example, using events from the `STAR` experiment at `RHIC`.
`STAR` data is stored in a `TTree`. To use the flow package for flow
analysis on this data, the information from the `TTree` needs to be
converted into an `AliFlowEventSimple`. In the specific case of the
`STAR` data, things are a bit more complicated than in the pseudo-code
example given in the previous section. Event- and track-level cuts still
have to be applied to the `STAR` data, therefore a `reader` class is
written which reads data from file, applies track and event cuts and
converts the `STAR` data to ‘star flow events’. This reading is left to
a dedicated class, `AliStarEventReader`, which reads a `TTree` and for
each event creates an `AliStarEvent`. The `AliStarEvent` is a derived
class which inherits from `AliFlowEventSimple` (similar to the
`MyFlowEvent` class from the example in the previous subsection). To
understand this process a bit better, we’ll take a look at a few code
snippets from the relevant classes and macros which are currently
present in `AliROOT`. A macro which reads `STAR` data and performs a
flow analysis can be found at
`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWGCF/FLOW/macros/runStarFlowAnalysis.C`.

~~~{.cxx}
      // connect the class which can read and understand your ttree to
      // the input data
      AliStarEventReader starReader(inputDataFiles) ;
      // loop as long as there are events
      while ( starReader.GetNextEvent() )                                // Get next event
      {
        // read a star event from the ttree
        AliStarEvent* starEvent = starReader.GetEvent();
        // see if the event meets event cuts (of course these are 
        // specific for STAR analysis, whether or not your ttree would
        // need such a cut is up to you
        if ( !starEventCuts->PassesCuts(starEvent) ) continue;

        // this is where flow package comes into play. 
        // at this moment, a star event has been read from a ttree, 
        // and is stored as a 'AliStarEvent'
        // in the next step, we'll create an AliFlowEventSimple from 
        // this star event using the AliFlowEventStar class, which is derived
        // from the AliFlowEventSimple class. 
        // as input, the AliFlowEventStar class receives the star event,
        // and a set of poi and rp cuts
        AliFlowEventSimple* flowEvent = new AliFlowEventStar(starEvent,rpCuts,poiCuts);  // make a flow event from a star event (aka "the magic")
        // for the scalar product method, we need to tag subevents
        flowEvent->TagSubeventsInEta(minA, maxA, minB, maxB );

        qc->Make(flowEvent);
        delete flowEvent;
      }
~~~

The most important piece of the code snippet printed here is the routine
where the `AliFlowEventSimple` is formed from the `AliStarEvent`. What
happens in the `AliFlowEventStar` class is the following:

~~~{.cxx}
    // class constructor
    AliFlowEventStar::AliFlowEventStar( const AliStarEvent* starevent,
                                        const AliStarTrackCuts* rpCuts,
                                        const AliStarTrackCuts* poiCuts ):
      // derived from AliFlowEventSimple, initialized to hold a certain number of 
      // tracks
      AliFlowEventSimple(starevent->GetNumberOfTracks())
    {
      //construct the flow event from the star event information
      SetReferenceMultiplicity(starevent->GetRefMult());
      // track loop
      for (Int_t i=0; i<starevent->GetNumberOfTracks(); i++)
      {
        // get star track from the star event
        const AliStarTrack* startrack = starevent->GetTrack(i);
        if (!startrack) continue;
        // build flow track simple (for the flow event)
        AliFlowTrackSimple* flowtrack = new AliFlowTrackSimple();
        // copy the kinematic information from the star track
        flowtrack->SetPhi(startrack->GetPhi());
        flowtrack->SetEta(startrack->GetEta());
        flowtrack->SetPt(startrack->GetPt());
        flowtrack->SetCharge(startrack->GetCharge());
        // see if the track is a reference track
        if (rpCuts)
        {
          Bool_t pass = rpCuts->PassesCuts(startrack);
          flowtrack->TagRP(pass); //tag RPs
          if (pass) IncrementNumberOfPOIs(0);
        }
        // see if the track is a particle of interest
        if (poiCuts)
        {
          flowtrack->TagPOI(poiCuts->PassesCuts(startrack)); //tag POIs
        }

### Getting started yourself

To get started with flow analysis on `TTree’s` yourself, a set of
example macros and classes is provided at
`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWGCF/FLOW/Documentation/examples/manual/ttree`. These
classes and macros will guide you through creating a `TTree` with data
from `ALICE` events in the analysis framework, and performing a flow
analysis on them using only `ROOT`. The example is set up as follows:

-   There are two macros (in macros folder)

    -   run: runs (in `AliROOT`) and fills a with kinematic info from
        `AliVEvent`

    -   read: reads (in just `ROOT`) the info and performs a flow
        analysis with the flow package

-   There are two analysis classes

    -   `AliAnalysisTaskTTreeFilter`, an analysis task for AliROOT which
        converts input events to a `TTree`

    -   `AliFlowEventSimpleFromTTree` a task for ROOT, fills flow events
        with `TTree` input

-   and lastly two helper classes which should serve as a starting point

    -   `AliFlowTTreeEvent`, a simple event class

    -   `AliFlowTTreeTrack`, a simple track class

As these are helper classes designed to get the user started, they are
not compiled by default. The run and read macro will them compile
on-the-fly.

Methods
=======

The flow package aims at providing the user with most of
the known flow analysis methods. Detailed theoretical overview of the
methods can be found in the following papers, which are included in the
folder `$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWGCF/FLOW/Documentation/otherdocs/`

-   Scalar Product Method  

    `EventPlaneMethod/FlowMethodsPV.pdf`

-   Generating Function Cumulants  

    `GFCumulants/Borghini_GFCumulants_PracticalGuide.pdf`

-   Q-vector Cumulant method  

    `QCumulants/QCpaperdraft.pdf`

-   Lee-Yang Zero Method  

    `LeeYangZeroes/Borghini_LYZ_PracticalGuide.pdf`

-   Lee-Yang Zero Method  

    `LeeYangZeroesEP/LYZ_RP.pdf`

The structure of this chapter is as follows: of each of the available
methods a short description is given in the `theory` subsection (for
more detailed information, see the papers listed above) followed by
details which are specific to the implementation in the subsection
`implementation`. Caveats, possible issues, etc, are listed in the
`caveats` subsections.

AliFlowAnalysisWithMCEventPlane
-------------------------------


### Theory

From the `.cxx` of the task:

~~~{.cxx}
    // Description: Maker to analyze Flow from the generated MC reaction plane.
    //              This class is used to get the real value of the flow 
    //              to compare the other methods to when analysing simulated events.
~~~

This method can be used to check what *v*<sub>*n*</sub> was generated in
an on-the-fly flow study or using the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` with
afterburner.

### Implementation

There is no specific information on the implementation here, for details
the reader is referred to the source code.

AliFlowAnalysisWithQCumulants
-----------------------------

### Implementation

*A how-to of the QC method in the flow-package is written by the author
of the analysis software and is available on the FLOW-PAG twiki page*
(<https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/ALICE/FlowPackageHowto>). *This
section is copied from the twiki page (and may therefore overlap with
other parts of this manual).*

To get the first feeling how the FLOW package and QC output are
organized, perhaps you can just trivially execute one ’on-the-fly’
example

Essentially, you have to do two things:

~~~{.cxx}
    cp $ALICE_PHYSICS/PWGCF/FLOW/macros/runFlowAnalysisOnTheFly.C .
    aliroot runFlowAnalysisOnTheFly.C 
~~~

In the analysis on-the-fly particles are sampled from hardwired
Fourier-like p.d.f, so input vn harmonics are completely under control.
Please have a look at the steering macro runFlowAnalysisOnTheFly.C and
corresponding class AliFlowEventSimpleMakerOnTheFly.cxx in the FLOW
package, which are easily written (no fancy C++ features in my code!),
and well documented.

If you have landed successfully, you will get an output
AnalysisResults.root, where the results from each method are structured
in directories.

To make a size of the file lighter (which matters a lot during
merging!), you may want not to use all the methods. You can make your
selection of the methods via:

~~~{.cxx}
    Bool_t MCEP = kTRUE; // Monte Carlo Event Plane
    Bool_t SP = kTRUE; // Scalar Product (a.k.a 'flow analysis with eta gaps')
    Bool_t GFC = kTRUE; // Generating Function Cumulants
    Bool_t QC = kTRUE; // Q-cumulants
    Bool_t FQD = kTRUE; // Fitted q-distribution
    Bool_t LYZ1SUM = kTRUE; // Lee-Yang Zero (sum generating function), first pass over the data
    Bool_t LYZ1PROD = kTRUE; // Lee-Yang Zero (product generating function), first pass over the data
    Bool_t LYZ2SUM = kFALSE; // Lee-Yang Zero (sum generating function), second pass over the data
    Bool_t LYZ2PROD = kFALSE; // Lee-Yang Zero (product generating function), second pass over the data
    Bool_t LYZEP = kFALSE; // Lee-Yang Zero Event Plane
    Bool_t MH = kFALSE; // Mixed Harmonics (used for strong parity violation studies) 
    Bool_t NL = kFALSE; // Nested Loops (neeed for debugging, only for developers)  
~~~

Next important remark, if you want to browse through
AnalysisResults.root, make sure that in AliROOT prompt you have loaded
the FLOW library:

~~~{.cxx}
    root [0] gSystem->Load("libPWGflowBase");   
~~~

In the AnalysisResults.root, the QC output is stored in
“outputQCanalysis”. Just browse there, browse in “cobjQC”, and you will
see the directory structure. “Integrated Flow”  ⇒  contains all results
needed for reference flow. Browse in, and explore the directory (in
fact, TList) “Results”. The names of the histos should be
self-explanatory; “Differential Flow”  ⇒  browse further into “Results”,
and you will find a bunch of things that you can explore. For instance,
in the directory “Differential Q-cumulants (POI,p**<sub>*T*</sub>)” you
will find histos holding differential QC{2} vs pt, QC{4} vs
p**<sub>*T*</sub>, etc. On the other hand, the flow estimates
themselves, namely differential vn{2} vs pt, vn{4} vs pt you can fetch
from TList “Differential Flow (POI,p**<sub>*T*</sub>)” I hope that the
names for all other things you might need are self-explanatory. You
configure QC method in the steering macro via setters:

~~~{.cxx}
    qc->SetHarmonic(2);
    qc->SetCalculateDiffFlow(kTRUE);
    qc->SetCalculate2DDiffFlow(kFALSE); // vs (pt,eta)
    qc->SetApplyCorrectionForNUA(kFALSE);
    qc->SetFillMultipleControlHistograms(kFALSE); 
    qc->SetMultiplicityWeight("combinations"); // default (other supported options are "unit" and "multiplicity")
    qc->SetCalculateCumulantsVsM(kFALSE);
    qc->SetCalculateAllCorrelationsVsM(kFALSE); // calculate all correlations in mixed harmonics "vs M"
    qc->SetnBinsMult(10000);
    qc->SetMinMult(0);
    qc->SetMaxMult(10000); 
    qc->SetBookOnlyBasicCCH(kFALSE); // book only basic common control histograms
    qc->SetCalculateDiffFlowVsEta(kTRUE); // if you set kFALSE only differential flow vs pt is calculated
    qc->SetCalculateMixedHarmonics(kFALSE); // calculate all multi-partice mixed-harmonics correlators  
~~~

You can make QC output lighter by setting

~~~{.cxx}
    qc->SetBookOnlyBasicCCH(kTRUE); 
~~~

(to book only basic control histograms, and disabling lot of 2D beasts),
and

~~~{.cxx}
    qc->SetCalculateDiffFlowVsEta(kFALSE);  
~~~

(if not interested in differential flow vs eta  ⇒  this will make the
final output smaller) In the “cobjQC” you might also consider
“AliFlowCommonHistQC” to be useful thing, which contains a lot of
trivial but still important control histograms (eg multiplicity
distribution of RPs, POIs, etc). I think this is the best and fastest
way for you to get familiar with the FLOW package =&gt; once you send
the QC code over the real data, you get the output organized in the very
same way. I will send you shortly an example set of macros which get be
used for the analysis on Grid over the real data. Differential QC{2} and
QC{4} implementation is generic. You can tag as RP and POI whatever you
want, and it will give you results automatically decoupled from any
autocorrelation effects. For this reason, it is important that if you
have certain particles which is classified both as RP and POI, to be
explicitly tagged also as RPs and POI once you are building the “flow
event”. The basic feature in the FLOW package is that from whichever
input you start, we have to build the same intermediate step called
“flow event”, with which than we feed all methods (SP, QC, etc) in the
very same way. To see what “flow event” does, and what does it need as
an input, you may want to consult task AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent.cxx and
classes needed there-in.

#### The scalar product method

The scalar product method estimates *v*<sub>*n*</sub> directly from
**Q** vectors:
$$\\label{sp\_func}
v\_n = \\frac{\\langle u \\cdotp Q \\rangle }{\\sqrt{\\langle Q\_A \\cdotp Q\_B \\rangle}}$$
 The denominator of equation \[sp\_func\] consists of two sub-event
**Q** vectors, **Q****<sub>*A*</sub> and **Q****<sub>*B*</sub>.
Sub-events are built from RP’s. These sub-event vectors are in the flow
package defined as coming from different *η* ranges.

To setup the different *η* ranges, one can use the
`AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` directly by calling

~~~{.cxx}
    AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent:: void SetSubeventEtaRange(Double_t minA, Double_t maxA, Double_t minB, Double_t maxB)
        {this->fMinA = minA; this->fMaxA = maxA; this->fMinB = minB; this->fMaxB = maxB; }
~~~

Sub-events can be re-tagged using the filter task, which will be
described in section [`Exotic`](#exotic). Internally, the tagging is
performed by the function

~~~{.cxx}
    AliFlowEventSimple::TagSubEventsInEta(Double_t etaMinA, Double_t etaMaxA, Double_t etaMinB, Double_t etaMaxB);
~~~

which should be called when you fill your flow events ‘by-hand’ and want
to tag sub-events.

The numerator of equation \[sp\_func\] is the correlator of the POI
**Q** vector (*u*) and a sub-event **Q** vector which is generally
referred to as the reference detector. In the flow package, this
sub-event **Q** vector is called ‘total q-vector’. The user of the task
needs to specify what part of the RP selection (that is, which
sub-events) are used as total **Q** vector. Passing this information to
the scalar product task is done in the following way

~~~{.cxx}
    AliAnalysisTaskScalarProduct:: void SetTotalQvector(const char *tqv) {*this->fTotalQvector = tqv;}; 
~~~

where the following options are available

~~~{.cxx}
      TString   *fTotalQvector;      // total Q-vector is: "QaQb" (means Qa+Qb), "Qa"  or "Qb" 
~~~

In general, one has to be a bit careful with setting up sub-events. Make
sure that the combination of reference detector and sub-events is
mathematically sound! An example of how to deal with complex setups is
given in the next section.

#### VZERO scalar product

The VZEROA and VZEROC detectors have different *η* coverage w.r.t the
TPC, so to evaluate v<sub>2</sub> from VZERO-SP, do
$$v\_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\langle u\_i \\cdotp Q\_A \\rangle }{\\sqrt{\\langle Q\_A \\cdotp Q\_B \\rangle}} \\cdotp \\frac{\\langle u\_j \\cdotp Q\_B \\rangle }{\\sqrt{\\langle Q\_A \\cdotp Q\_B \\rangle}}}$$

-   Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> are the VZEROC and VZEROA
    RP’s

What is up for debate is the following: how do we defined the POI’s?

-   Take u = full TPC = u<sub>j</sub> = u<sub>i</sub>, or do
    u<sub>j</sub> = η &lt; 0, u<sub>i</sub> = η &gt; 0 ?

In the elliptic flow analysis of identified particles, majority vote has
yielded the following:

-   u = full TPC = u<sub>j</sub> = u<sub>i</sub>

so that in the end the published points were obtained using
$$v\_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\langle u \\cdotp Q\_A \\rangle }{\\sqrt{\\langle Q\_A \\cdotp Q\_B \\rangle}} \\cdotp \\frac{\\langle u \\cdotp Q\_B \\rangle }{\\sqrt{\\langle Q\_A \\cdotp Q\_B \\rangle}}}$$
 Note that this requires running *two* scalar product tasks in the flow
package (one for each reference detector) the output *v*<sub>2</sub> of
which was in turn multiplied point-by-point in p<sub>T</sub>.

#### Extension to Event Plane method

By normalizing the **Q** vectors, the scalar product method is
essentially reduced to the ‘classic’ event plane method. Normalization
of the **Q** vectors can be set using

~~~{.cxx}
    AliAnalysisTaskScalarProduct::SetBehaveAsEP()
~~~

Developing your own task
------------------------

Of course this list of flow analysis methods could be extended. Adding a
new flow analysis method means developing two classes: a ‘base’ class
where the method is implemented and a ‘tasks’ class to interface with
the analysis manager. As a starting point, ‘templates’ have been
developed, which are just empty base and task classes in the flow
package. You can find these at

base  
`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/Base/AliFlowAnalysisTemplate.cxx (h)`

tasks  
`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/Tasks/AliAnalysisTaskTemplate.cxx (h)`

More exotic uses

This chapter deals with more ‘exotic’ uses of the flow package.

Flow analysis in the LEGO framework: re-tagging your POI and RP selections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To save resources, it is beneficial to construct analysis trains in
which just one flow event is created which is passed to multiple
analysis tasks. This can be inconvenient when the different analysis
tasks require different POI and RP selections[20]. To overcome this, a
filter task, `AliAnalysisTaskFilterFE`, has been developed, which can
run between the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent` and a specific flow analysis
task, and can re-tag POI’s and RP’s. The re-tagging is performed by
looping over all tracks in an event and checking whether or not these
tracks pass a selection of simple cuts. The filter task can only re-tag
existing tracks in the flow event, it cannot add new tracks to the flow
event. To illustrate the functionality of the filtertask, we’ll take the
example of section [`Examples`](#examples) but perform the analysis using
different |*η*| windows for RP’s.

The first step towards filtering is setting up the filtering criteria.
These are defined using the `AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts` object:

~~~{.cxx}
    // create the simple cuts object
    AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts* filterRP = new AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts("filterRP"); 
    // specify a rapidity interval
    filterRP->SetEtaMin(-0.4);
    filterRP->SetEtaMax(0.4);
~~~

All available filtering options in `AliFlowTrackSimpleCuts` are:

~~~{.cxx}
      //setters
      void SetPtMax(Double_t max)   {this->fPtMax = max; fCutPt=kTRUE; }
      void SetPtMin(Double_t min)   {this->fPtMin = min; fCutPt=kTRUE;  }
      void SetEtaMax(Double_t max)  {this->fEtaMax = max; fCutEta=kTRUE; }
      void SetEtaMin(Double_t min)  {this->fEtaMin = min; fCutEta=kTRUE; }
      void SetEtaGap(Double_t min, Double_t max)
            {fEtaGapMin = min, fEtaGapMax = max, fCutEtaGap = kTRUE; }
      void SetPhiMax(Double_t max)  {this->fPhiMax = max; fCutPhi=kTRUE; }
      void SetPhiMin(Double_t min)  {this->fPhiMin = min; fCutPhi=kTRUE; }
      void SetPID(Int_t pid)        {this->fPID = pid; fCutPID=kTRUE; }
      void SetCharge(Int_t c)       {this->fCharge = c; fCutCharge=kTRUE; }
      void SetMassMax(Double_t max) {this->fMassMax = max; fCutMass=kTRUE; }
      void SetMassMin(Double_t min) {this->fMassMin = min; fCutMass=kTRUE; }
~~~

All cuts are disabled by default.

The second step is constructing the filter class object itself:

~~~{.cxx}
    // create the filter task object. note that the desired cuts have to be passed 
    // in the constructor, the 0x0 that is passed means that POI's will not be filtered
    AliAnalysisTaskFilterFE* filterTask = AliAnalysisTaskFilterFE("filter task", filterRP, 0x0);
~~~

Sub-events can also be re-defined using the filter task. To do so, call

~~~{.cxx}
    AliAnalysisTaskFilterFE::SetSubeventEtaRange(Double_t minA, Double_t maxA, Double_t minB, Double_t maxB)
        {this->fMinA = minA; this->fMaxA = maxA; this->fMinB = minB; this->fMaxB = maxB; }
~~~

If yo use the filter task for a flow analysis method which uses
sub-events, make sure that you set the correct *η* ranges! Otherwise,
the default values will be used, which may (or may not) be correct for
your analysis.

The `UserExec()` of the filter task is as follows:

~~~{.cxx}
    void AliAnalysisTaskFilterFE::UserExec(Option_t *)
    {
      // Main loop
      fFlowEvent = dynamic_cast<AliFlowEventSimple*>(GetInputData(0)); // from TaskSE
      if (!fFlowEvent) return;
      if(fCutsRFP) fFlowEvent->TagRP(fCutsRFP);
      if(fCutsPOI) fFlowEvent->TagPOI(fCutsPOI);
      fFlowEvent->TagSubeventsInEta(fMinA,fMaxA,fMinB,fMaxB);
      PostData(1,fFlowEvent);
    }
~~~

Now that the filter task has been configured, it needs to be added to
the analysis chain. As stated, the task needs to be put *in between* the
flow event task and the flow analysis method.

~~~{.cxx}
    // get the analysis manager
    AliAnalysisManager *mgr = AliAnalysisManager::GetAnalysisManager();
    // add the fitler task to the manager (should be done before the
    // analysis task is added!)
    mgr->AddTask(filterTask);
    // create a temporary container which the filter task will pass to the 
    // analysis task
    AliAnalysisDataContainer *coutputFilter = mgr->CreateContainer(
       "FilterContainer",
       AliFlowEventSimple::Class(),
       AliAnalysisManager::kExchangeContainer);
    // connect the output of the flow analysis task as input to the filter task
    mgr->ConnectInput(filterTask, 0, coutputFE);
    // and connect the filter container as output
    mgr->ConnectOutput(filterTask, 1, coutputFilter);
    // pass the filter task output to the analysis method   
    // (this is assuming you already have setup the analysis task as
    // explained in the example in section 3.4.3
    mgr->ConnectInput(taskQC[i], 0, coutputFilter);
~~~

### Caveats

Note that the filter task will change the tags of the flow tracks in the
flow event. *Every* analysis task that runs after the filter task in an
analysis train will therefore be affected by the re-taggging that is
performed by the filter task. Often it can be useful to run multiple
filter tasks with different configurations in an analysis train.

Flow analysis of resonances
---------------------------

One notable case in which the filter task is useful, is the flow
analysis of rapidly decaying particles via the invariant mass method. If
a particle decays to daughter particles, e.g.
Λ → *π* + *p*
 one can do an invariant mass flow analysis, which basically comprises

1.  Take all the *π* + *p* pairs in an event and plot their invariant
    mass

2.  Extract the signal yield and total yield from this distribution

3.  Measure *v*<sub>2</sub> of all *π* + *p* pairs

Under the assumption that signal and background flow are additive, their
contributions can be disentangled by solving
$$v\_2^{T}(m\_{inv})  = v\_2^{S} \\frac{N^{S} }{N^{S} + N^{B}}(m\_{inv})  + v\_2^{B}(m\_{inv}) \\frac{ N^{B}}{N^{S} + N^{B}}(m\_{inv})$$
 for *v*<sub>2</sub><sup>*S*</sup>. To do so,
*v*<sub>2</sub><sup>*T*</sup>(*m*<sub>*i**n**v*</sub>) must be measured.
This can be done by measuring the *v*<sub>2</sub> of all possible
*π* + *p* pairs in different invariant mass intervals. When a flow event
is filled by-hand with *π* + *p* pairs, the filter task can then be in
turn be used to split the flow event into invariant mass intervals and
perform flow analysis on those separately, thereby extracting all
necessary information. Examples of such analyses are e.g. the
$\\varhi$-meson flow analysis
(`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/Tasks/AliAnalylsisTaskPhiFlow`) or the Λ and
*K*<sup>0</sup> flow task
(`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/Tasks/AliAnalysisTaskFlowStrange`).

Non-uniform acceptance correction
---------------------------------

In practice a detector can have inefficiencies which result in a
non-uniform acceptance which might bias the measured v<sub>n</sub>
signal. One way of compensating for this is using track weights (as
explained in section [`Track Weights`](#trackweights). Another way of correcting for
these effects is by adjusting the `Q` vectors based on the assumption
that the underlying `Q` vector distribution itself is flat.

By default all necessary information to perform such a correction is
stored when running a flow analysis task. The actual correction itself
is performed when `Finish()` is called, depending whether or not the
flag to perform the correction is set to `kTRUE`.

The effects of the acceptance correction can always be checked by
running the `redoFinish.C` macro, by toggling the flag

    Bool_t bApplyCorrectionForNUA = kFALSE; // apply correction for non-uniform acceptance

to either false or true.

### Caveats

The non-uniform acceptance correction is based on the assumption that
the physical `Q` vector distribution in your event sample is flat. This
works for minimum bias events, but might not work for e.g. triggered
events or for event samples where the detector efficiency varies
event-by-event. Details pertaining to the implementation can be found in
the `Finish()` methods of the various flow analysis tasks.

Summary
=======

After reading the documentation, you should have a general feeling of
how the flow package is organized and be able to do a standard flow
analysis. This however is just where the fun begins! Connect your
classes, write a new method, add new routines ⋯ and publish your paper!

[1] The `ALICE` flow package is part of `AliROOT`, the ALICE extension
of the `ROOT` framework, which can be obtained from
<http://git.cern.ch/pub/AliRoot>. The flow package itself is located in
the folder `$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/`, where `$ALICE_PHYSICS` refers to the
source directory of `AliROOT`.

[2] In this example the `AliFlowEventSimple` class will be used to
generate toy events (which is described in detail in section
[`Program`](#program)). 

[3] In data, some of these steps are actually taken care of by an
analysis task, but this will be described in more detail in the next
chapter.

[4] In aliroot, this macro can be found at  
`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWGCF/FLOW/Documentation/examples/manual/runFlowOnTheFlyExample`

[5] The on the fly event generator is not limited to the generation of
the second harmonic v<sub>2</sub>, but to get started, this is a nice
example.

[6] Make sure that `libPWGflowBase.so` is loaded in your `(Ali)ROOT`
session, otherwise these objects will be unknown.

[7] The headers of both output objects can be found in
`$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/Base/`.

[8] The word common here is used to indicate histograms that hold
observables which are evaluated in all flow analysis methods. Specific
analysis methods may however store additional histograms which are not
covered in this list!

[9] `$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWGCF/FLOW/macros/compareFlowResults.C`

[10] `$ALICE_PHYSICS/...`

[11] `$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/FLOW/Tasks/AliFlowEventCuts.cxx`

[12] `$ALICE_ROOT/ANALYSIS/AliESDtrackCuts.cxx`

[13] `$ALICE_ROOT/STEER/STEERBas/AliPID.h`

[14] A ‘getter’ in this manual will be used to describe a function of
the form `Get\*()` which returns a (pointer to) a member of a class
and is used to interface with the class.

[15] This section is very brief an incomplete, but keep in mind that
this is a flow package manual, and not an `AliROOT` tutorial.

[16] `$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWGCF/FLOW/macros/refoFinish.C`

[17] In the example macro this is a not necessary as you already have a
pointer to the manager in your macro. However, if you split the macro
into a steering macro and AddTask macro, the AddTask macro needs to
retrieve a pointer to the manager which is created in the steering
macro.

[18] The actual event selection based on triggers is done in the
`AliAnalysisTaskSE` class (to be specific, the trigger is checked in
`AliAnalysisTaskSE::Exec()`) from which the `AliAnalysisTaskFlowEvent`
is derived. The full set of available triggers can be found in the
virtual event header `AliVEvent.h`.

[19] A makefile to compile the `libPWGflowBase.so` library from the
command line will be added to `$ALICE_ROOT/PWGCF/FLOW/macros/ ...`

[20] A notable example of this is doing an invariant mass analysis,
which will briefly be touched in the next section.
