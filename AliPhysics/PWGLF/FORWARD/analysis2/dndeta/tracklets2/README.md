Re-implementation of Ruben's tracklet dNch/deta code (deprecated) {#pwglf_fwd_spd_tracklet_2}
=================================================================

The code in this sub-directory is a re-implementation of Ruben's code
for analysing SPD tracklet data for dNch/deta.  

The code differs from Ruben's mostly in organization e.g., the MC
part is split into a separate (derived) class, the output is organized
in to a hierarchy of containers, and the Terminate method tries to do
as many calculations as possible up front. 

Eventually, the code here can go into a binary compiled library.
