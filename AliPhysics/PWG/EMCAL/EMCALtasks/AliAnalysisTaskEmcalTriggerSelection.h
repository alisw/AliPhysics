/**
 * @class AliAnalysisTaskEmcalTriggerSelection
 * @brief Task providing an event selection for EMCAL-triggered events based on the
 * reconstructed EMCAL trigger patches
 * @ingroup EMCALFWTASKS
 * @author Markus Fasel <markus.fasel@cern.ch> Oak Ridge National Laboratory
 * @since Dec 17, 2014
 * 
 * # Perparation wagon for transparent trigger selection by users
 * 
 * Trigger event selection is centralized in this task. The trigger selecion
 * is implemented in trigger selecion object, selecting all trigger patches
 * firing the trigger using a trigger patch cut object fully describing the trigger.
 * Trigger selections have to be configured by the user and should fully describe 
 * all Level1 triggers supported in the corresponding dataset (for simulation the 
 * dataset it is anchored to). Typically different modes are used on data and
 * simulation:
 * 
 * - Data: Selection based on FastOR ADC, used to cleanup noisy triggers or 
 *   equalize triggers for different periods with different settings
 * - Simulation: Selection based on FEE energy with an energy threshold corresponding
 *   to the ADC threshold applied in data, used to simulate the trigger response
 * 
 * Users have to configure the task acording to the different modes and the settings
 * matching the dataset. For several datasets default configurations are already 
 * implemented. Missing configurations are implemented by the author on user request.
 * 
 * The trigger selection tasks appends an object to the event where users can easily
 * query the trigger selection so the selection based on trigger primitives (patches)
 * is centralized and not needed in the user analysis. The object can be retrieved
 * by the users from the event.
 * 
 * The task has also a builtin QA for each trigger class, monitoring the energy spectra
 * of all trigger patches and of the main trigger patches. It is recommended to always
 * run the trigger selection QA - resource consumption should not be an issue.
 * 
 * ## Adding the wagon to the train
 * 
 * An add macro is provided under PWG/EMCAL/AddEmcalTriggerSelectionTask.C which can be
 * used to configure the train wagon. The macro customization should include the following
 * lines:
 * 
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * __R_ADDTASK__->SetGlobalDecisionContainerName("EmcalTriggerDecision");
 * __R_ADDTASK__->AutoConfigure(kDataset);
 * ~~~
 *
 * kDataset should be the name of a supported dataset. Please refer to the description of class 
 * PWG::EMCAL::AliAnalysisTaskEmcalTriggerSelection for supported datasets.
 * 
 * ## Configuring the trigger selection task for the corresponding period
 * 
 * Default configurations exists for run 1 pp (2012, 8 TeV) and for run2 pp (2016-2018, 13 TeV)
 * and the corresponding datasets. For existing configurations and the corresponing cut
 * settings please refer to the matching Configure function.
 * 
 * An AutoConfigure function provides a frontend for the user to configure the task based
 * on the dataset name, and internally mapping datasets to configurations. On the data side
 * pp datasets for 2012 and 2016-2018 are fully supported. Unfortunately the situation is 
 * more complicated on the simulation side: Due to the absence of a logical naming scheme
 * where an algorithm can extract whether it is a simulation dataset or what period it is 
 * anchored to, supported datasets must be handled by a lookup table, and this can by far
 * not be complete. Users should contact the author in case a new dataset should be added
 * to the configuration.
 * 
 * Configuration by hand is also possible. This is of relevance for systematic studies of
 * the trigger response via cut variations. Users have to provide a trigger selection via
 * the function AddTriggerSelection. Each trigger selection object represents one Level1
 * trigger. For such configurations it is recommended to use a config macro.
 * 
 * ## Accessing the trigger selection in the user task
 * 
 * After processing the trigger selection the task appends a container with the selection
 * results for each trigger supported for the dataset to the input event. The trigger decision
 * container provides information about
 * 
 * - Trigger selection status
 * - Main patch according to the energy and patch specification
 * - All trigger patches firing the trigger
 * - The trigger selection cuts
 * 
 * Users can use the trigger selection container in order to select events as triggered events
 * for the given trigger in case the selection status is true. The name of the trigger must
 * match the name in the configuration. Names of trigger classes follow the EMCAL naming convention.
 * The following example reads the trigger decision container from the event and selects events
 * as EG1 event:
 * 
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * auto trgsel = static_cast<PWG::EMCAL::AliEmcalTriggerDecisionContainer *>(input->FindListObject("EmcalTriggerDecision"))
 * if(trgsel->IsEventSelected("EG1")) std::cout << "Event selected as EG1 event" << std::endl; 
 * ~~~
