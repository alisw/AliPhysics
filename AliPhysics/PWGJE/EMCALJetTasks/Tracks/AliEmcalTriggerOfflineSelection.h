 * @class AliEmcalTriggerOfflineSelection
 * @brief Helper class selecting events on the presence of a trigger patch for the given type above threshold
 * @ingroup PWGJETASKS
 * @author Markus Fasel <markus.fasel@cern.ch>, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
 * @since Feb 23, 2016
 *
 * AliEmcalTriggerOffline selection provides the functionality to select triggered events
 * based on the presence of a trigger patch for the given type above energy threshold. As convention
 * the calibrated energy from cells is used to select patches above threshold. Energy thresholds
 * can be set via
 *
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * AliEmcalTriggerOfflineSelection sel
 * // Setting 10 GeV threshold for the L1 gamma trigger
 * sel.SetOfflineEnergyThreshold(AliEmcalTriggerOfflineSelection::kTrgEG1, 10.);
 * ~~~
 *
 * In order to mimic non-uniform trigger acceptance, acceptance maps from Data can be
 * used in the trigger patch selection. When available, trigger patches are selected
 * on a statistical basis using the map, which is expected to be normalized to the
 * position with the maximum trigger counts, in order to provide a probability value.
 * Acceptance maps are set via
 *
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * TH2 *accEG1; // User is responsible to load the histogram
 * sel.SetAcceptanceMap(AliEmcalTriggerOfflineSelection::kTrgEG1, accEG1);
 * ~~~
 *
 * Attention: This class takes over ownership and expects the histogram to not belong to a
 * directory. In case no acceptance map is providede, no acceptance mimicing is applied.
