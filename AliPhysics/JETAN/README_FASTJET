Instructions to interface FastJet in AliRoot

The following steps help you interface Aliroot with Fastjet 

1- Install fastjet-2.3.4 from http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~salam/fastjet 

2- Modify Fastjet installation (temporary)
   Root can not read the fastjet classes due to a bug in the CINT interprete (see report: https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?41608#attached ).
   Therefore, once you've installed fastjet, go to the installation include location and then do

   sed -i -e 's/^FASTJET_BEGIN_NAMESPACE/namespace fastjet \{/' \
       -e 's/^FASTJET_END_NAMESPACE.*/\} \/\/ fastjet namespace /' \
       -e 's/^#define FASTJET/\/\/ #define FASTJET/' \
       fastjet/*.hh fastjet/*/*.hh 
  
  
3- Setup the following environment variables

   #if you have CGAL 
   setenv CGAL_MAKEFILE /path to CGAL makefile  (this is mandatory for Fastjet)
   setenv CGAL_LIB /path to CGAL libraries 
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $CGAL_LIB\:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   #Fastjet 
   setenv FASTJET /path to Fastjet installation directory
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $FASTJET/lib\:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4- Update $ALICE_ROOT/JETAN module with the new Alice Fastjet classes

   AliFastJetFinder.h .cxx
   AliFastJetHeader.h .cxx
   
   Note: as soon as the SVN AliRoot/JETAN is updated you don't have to do it anymore   

5- Recompile JETAN module in AliRoot
   
   cd $ALICE_ROOT
   make

6- Test if the interface is working.
   Run the following test macro to check that you can call Fastjet algorithms from AliRoot. 
   
   % aliroot
   root [0] .x testFastJet.C

7- Now you are ready to use Fastjet within the Alice Analysis framework (by the moment with local ESD files) using the AliAnalysisTaskJets class. Here is an example of configuration file for Fastjet.

   ConfigJetAnalysisFastjet.C 
   
   
   
 NOTES: 
 - The following interface can be used for all the jet algorithms present in Fastjet. The interface with the SiSCone plug-in will be included soon. 
 
 - The defaults set up parameters are not optimized, we are working on it.
