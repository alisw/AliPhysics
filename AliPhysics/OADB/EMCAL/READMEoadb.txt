/*! \page READMEoadb Accessing the EMCAL OADB from EOS

The EMCal OADB files have been moved to the EOS directory /eos/experiment/alice/analysis-data/OADB/EMCAL which is accessible via lxplus.
Analysis tasks can access these files via, for example: ```AliDataFile::GetFileNameOADB("EMCAL/EMCALTimeL1PhaseCalib.root")``` which has been implemented into the Tender and the Correction Framework as well as most analysis tasks in AliPhysics.
If you want to have the OADB files locally, you can download them from lxplus via:
~~~{.sh}
rsync -av --delete cern_user@lxplus.cern.ch:/eos/experiment/alice/analysis-data/ /path/to/my/local/oadb/
~~~

In order for local tests to work properly, please add the ALICE_DATA global variable to your bashrc or similar.
~~~{.sh}
ALICE_DATA=/path/to/my/local/oadb
~~~

Furthermore, the "export" command should be used in addition to adding the path to the bashrc. This will make the variable available to all processes:
~~~{.sh}
export ALICE_DATA=/path/to/my/local/oadb
~~~

The code for the creation of the OADB files as well as for bookkeeping of input files can be found in the following repository: https://gitlab.cern.ch/alice-EMC/EMCCalib
