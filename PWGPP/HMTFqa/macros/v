We present the first results of event-by-event fluctionss in identified particle ratios measured in ALICE experiement at LHC using  ν(dyn) methods. The ν(dyn) has been estimated for k/pi, p/pi, k/p along with all like sign and unlike sign to gain more insight into the origin of these fluctuations.  

which, by its construction, is free from the collisional bias. Where a and b are the particles combintation from pi,pi,k,k,p,p. 



In order to gain insight into the origin of these uctuations, we calculate ν(dyn,ab) for the combination of each particles from π+,π−, K+,K−, p, and p. Furthermore we have performed a comparison study for scaling with dN/dη, Npart to observe the geometric effect. 

The result will be compared with different model and discussed.


The study of Event-by-Event fluctuations opens new possibilities to
investigate the properties of de-confined state of matter and phase structure.
Dynamical fluctuations in global conserved quantities such as baryon number,
strangeness, or charge may be observed in the vicinity of these phase transition.
The best method to study these fluctuations would be in ratios of different
observables, as the particle ratio is an intensive quantity and the volume
fluctuations cancels out in these ratios.
