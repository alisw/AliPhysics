process.sh:

Script to run each post-processing macro on 
respective outputs 

Simple script to execute macros and produce output

  Requirement: the macro paths need to be defined
  ex:  CODE=$ALICE_ROOT/PWGPP/analysisQA

  Arguments for each macro should be change by
  collecting proper information from respective
  wagon owner.

  sh process.sh <output.root> <aod-number>
  ex: sh process.sh output.root 145 eps

processJETrackQA.C

Processes the results of the JE_PWG4HighPtTrackQA wagon. Should be run with the following arguments:
TString strFileIn   = "AnalysisResults.root" : the path to the input file.
TString suffix      = "eps"                  : the suffix that determines the output format. For example: eps, pdf, png, etc.
Int_t cent          = 10                     : the centrality class of the results. Options: 0 (0-10%), 1 (10-30%), 2 (30-50%), 3 (50-80%) and 10 (0-80%). Usually they are published with class 10.
Int_t trig          = 1                      : linked to the trigger. Default depends on data period: lhc11h: 1, containing lhc12 or lhc13: 5, or else: 6. On doubt one can always referr to the table at the bottom of this paragraph in after checking the AnalysisResults.root file with a browser.
Bool_t bESD         = kFALSE                 : an obsolete variable. Might be removed in the future.
Int_t run           = 0                      : enables to add a run number to the plots. Not neccessary for general QA, and can be suppresed by giving the number 0.
const char *outfile ="JETrackQA_output.root" : the path to the place to store the plots as root file. This is in addition to the image files made with in the 'suffix' format.
List of triggers:
  if(trig==1) strTrigger = "kCentral";
  if(trig==2) strTrigger = "kSemiCentral";
  if(trig==3) strTrigger = "kMBkCentralkSemiCentral";
  if(trig==4) strTrigger = "kEMCEJE";
  if(trig==5) strTrigger = "kINT7";
  if(trig==6) strTrigger = "kMB";

processJETriggerQA.C

This is an old version of the macro. Use V2 if possible. Only use this for old results.

processJETriggerQA_V2.C

Processes the results of the JE_TriggerQAFullR020 wagon, and if present, can also be used for the results of the JE_TriggerQAFullR020_EMCEGA and JE_TriggerQAFullR020_EMCEJE wagon. Should be run with the following arguments:
TString strFileIn    = "AnalysisResults.root"      : the path to the input file.
TString suftype      ="eps"                        : the suffix that deternmines the output format. For example: eps, pdf, png, etc.
Float_t jetR         = 0.2                         : the jetR. Default train value is 0.2, but can otherwise be found by opening the AnalysisResults.root file with the browser.
Float_t minTrkPT     = 0.15                        : the lower Track momentum cut-off. Default train value is 0.15, but can otherwise be found by opening the AnalysisResults.root file with the browser.
Float_t minClusterET = 0.3                         : the lower Cluster energy cut-off. Default train value is 0.3, but can otherwise be found by opening the AnalysisResults.root file with the browser.
Int_t run            = 0                           : enables to add a run number to the plots. Not neccessary for general QA, and can be suppresed by giving the number 0.
TString trigsuffix   = ""                          : leave empty to open the results of the JE_TriggerQAFullR020 wagon, but or use "EJE" or "EGA" to use the triggered results otherwise.
const char* outfile  = "JETriggerQA_outfile.root"  : the path to the place to store the plots as root file. This is in addition to the image files made with in the 'suffix' format.
