/// \class AliTrackContainerV0
/// \brief Select tracks based on specific prescriptions of V0s in jets analysis
///
/// This class derives from AliParticleContainer. 
/// It allows to select tracks based on specific prescriptions of analysis
/// of V0 particles associated with jets.
/// Namely, it remove the V0 daughter tracks from track sample prior
/// to jet finding procedure (based on track IDs).
