C.    *  Calculates cross-section of current material for RAYLEIGH     *
C.    *  EFFECT using  polinomial fits of tables in log-log scale.     *
C.    *  One fit (4 coefficients) for each element is used.            *
C.    *  Atomic form factors are calculated as a function of momentum  *
C.    *  transfer using polinomial fits of data tables in log-log scale*
C.    *  One or two fits are used according with the value of NFIT.    *
C.    *  Evaluates the integral of atomic form factors which will be   *
C.    *  used in the SUBROUTINE GRAYL to sample scattering angles      *
C.    *  NOTE:                                                         *
