# Configuration and compilation

./Configure -build

# As asnwer choose the default (proposed) value, except of the following
# (please note that the "Question" word itself is not displayed)


# Question: Specify the path where Geant4 libraries and source files should be
# installed. $ALICE/geant4

# Question: Directory $ALICE/geant4 doesn't exist.  Use that name anyway? Y

# Question: Do you want to copy all Geant4 headers in one directory? Y

# Question: Please, specify where CLHEP is installed: $ALICE/CLHEP

# Question: Do you want to build 'shared' (.so) libraries? Y

# Question:
#  G4VIS_BUILD_OPENGLX_DRIVER
#  G4VIS_USE_OPENGLX
#
# It is an interface to the de facto standard 3D graphics library,
# OpenGL. It is well suited for real-time fast visualization
# and prototyping. The X11 version of the OpenGL libraries is
# required. Y

# Question:
#  G4LIB_BUILD_G3TOG4  
#
# The utility module 'g3tog4' will be built by setting this
# variable. NOTE: it requires a valid FORTRAN compiler to be
# installed on your system and the 'cernlib' command in the
# path, in order to build the ancillary tools!
# Do you want to build 'g3tog4' ? Y

# now a long compilation...

# Installation in the selected place ($ALICE/geant4)
./Configure -install

# Environment variables (please note the "dot" in the beginning)
# The <platform> has to ve replaced by the actiual value
