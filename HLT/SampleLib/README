This README describes the procedure to create a customized component 
library for the ALICE HLT.

Please send corrections/suggestions/bugreports to
Matthias.Richter@ift.uib.no

Part A describes a library embedded into the ALICE HLT build system
Part B gives a  recipe for using this package stand-alone

Note: You can not mix the two alternatives since this would confuse aototools. 
Our suggestions: If you are developing anyway with the AliRoot HLT module 
choose alternative A. If you don't use the HLT module explicitly choose 
alternative B.

If you have downloaded the 'alice-hlt-sample' package and want to build and 
modify it, go directly to Part B.

This describes how to create a new component library embedded into the
ALICE HLT build system. We asume that you have a version of the AliRoot
HLT module installed. The top level directory of the package is referred
as 'topdir' from now on.

1. Choose a name for your library and the sub-folder: 
   e.g. 'libAliHLTTest' in folder 'Test'
2. Go to the topdir:
> cd <topdir>

3. Copy the SampleLib folder as new 'Test' folder
> cp -a SampleLib Test

4. Copy libAliHLTSample.pkg to libAliHLTTest.pkg
> cp libAliHLTSample.pkg libAliHLTTest.pkg

5. Change dir to the new folder
> cd Test

6. Open 'Makefile.am' with an editor
   This is the Makefile template for the autotools build system. In particular
   one defines the library to be built to the lib_LTLIBRARIES variable. 
   Furthermore, source and header files have to be specified, but in our case
   this is done in the 'lib***.pkg file. By using such a file the library can
   later easily be added to AliRoot.
6.1. replace all strings 'AliHLTSample' with 'AliHLTTest'

7. Now, you can think about implementing a new component. The packge contains
   three example components:
   - AliHLTDummyComponent: a real component which copies data from the input
     to the output
   - AliHLTSampleComponent1/2: two dummy components which just demonstrate 
     how several components can be implemented in one library
   Each of the components has a header file '<component>.h' and a source code
   file '<component>.cxx
7.1 Take the DummyComponent, copy the two files (to your component name):
> cp AliHLTDummyComponent.h MyTestComponent.h
> cp AliHLTDummyComponent.cxx MyTestComponent.cxx
7.2 Implement the required methods. A tutorial will be added to this package
   soon. A comprehensive online tutorial is available at
   http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/wiki/HLT

8. Once you are finnished with the first code development, you have to add
   the new component files to the build system. Open 'libAliHLTTest.pkg' in
   the package topdir
8.1. Add all your source files to the SRCS variable, remove the files from
     the libAliHLTSample
8.2. Add all header files of classes which should be added to the ROOT
     dictionary to the CLASS_HDRS variable, remove the files from the
     libAliHLTSample
8.3. All other header files must be added to the HDRS variable, including the
     content of the CLASS_HEADERS

9. Now we just have to add our new library to the build system. 
9.1 Open Makefile.am in the topdir and add 'Test' to the list of SUBDIRS
9.2 Open configure.ac in the topdir and add 'Test/Makefile' to the list of
    files to be created: AC_CONFIG_FILES at the end of configure.ac

10.Make sure that all files are saved. Now follow the instruction from the
   README in the topdir. In principle its enough to go to your build directory
   and simply type
> make
> make install

1. Overview
===========
This package provides a compilation of shared libraries of the ALICE
HLT project and is intended for stand-alone compilation, i.e. not as part 
of the AliRoot compilation. 


2. Requirements
===============
At this point you should have downloaded and unpacked a package with name
alice-hlt-sample.tar.gz. If not, please download it from
http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/ti/HLT/software/download/alice-hlt-sample.tar.gz
The following description refers to that package.

The package needs both ROOT and AliRoot. Both must be set up in the
usual way (ROOTSYS, ALICE_ROOT, library locations evtl. specified in
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ...). The package also needs the ALICE HLT component
framework. This is part of AliRoot from version v4-05-Release on. You can
also download the package from
http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/wiki/HLT

To set up a version retrieved from CVS, autoconf 2.57, automake 1.6
,and libtool 1.4 or higher versions are required. Thats the versions
which come with the Scientific Linux CERN 3. The same applies if
you want to change the Makefiles.

If your GNU build tools are too old, ask the maintainers for a distributed
package.  

3. Setting up a version retrieved from CVS
==========================================
Skip this section if you have started from the tar ball.

A version checked out from CVS requires a few steps to set up the Makefiles.
Go to the directory and run
autoreconf -i -f

Then continue with the package configuration described in the 'Installation'
section.

4. Modifying a distributed package
==================================
If you are going the modify a distributed package you might need to re-make 
the GNU build system by running
 autoreconf -f -i

Please notify the authors about bug fixes/corrections/extensions you made if
you consider them worth to be merged into the project.

Then continue with the package configuration described in the 'Installation'
section.

5. Installation
===============
Package build relies on the GNU triplet configure, make and make install.
In order to keep the development directory clean, it is recommended to
use a separate build directory. Please read the full section before you
start. The build is in priciple done like

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure
  make
  make install

You should redirect the output of the make into a file.
The default install directory is set to the current directory ($PWD). To
override the default directory use the option --prefix=<dir>. More information
can be obtained from the configure script by running it with option --help.
All binary libraries will be installed under <prefix>/lib. 
If the directory is equal to $ALICE_ROOT, the libraries will be installed under 
<prefix>/lib/tgt_<arch> as used for AliRoot. This is a custom extension in
order to adapt to the specific AliRoot installation directories.

You might need to specify the installation path of the ALICE HLT component
framework during packge configuration. This can be done by the option
--with-hltbase.
Please follow correctly the installation procedure of the framework package.

Note: You can have several build directories with different configure options,
(e.g. AliRoot versions) but using the same source code. 

If you need further information on the GNU build system, execute from the 
top directory:
./configure --help | less

6. Code Development
===================
Once you are finnished with the build of the package, you can think about
changing the code. The packge contains three example components:
- AliHLTDummyComponent: a real component which copies data from the input
  to the output
- AliHLTSampleComponent1/2: two dummy components which just demonstrate 
  how several components can be implemented in one library
Each of the components has aheader file '<component>.h' and a source code
file '<component>.cxx

Leave your build directory and go back to the top directory where you can find 
the source code as well as the Makefile template Makefile.am. 
1. Choose a new name of your library (the tutorial uses AliHLTTest)

2. Copy libAliHLTSample.pkg to libAliHLTTest.pkg
> cp libAliHLTSample.pkg libAliHLTTest.pkg

3. follow the instructions 6 to 8 of Part A (embedded case).

When you are done with this, you can build the library by typing 'make' in your
build directory, and install it by make install.

7. Documentation
================
NOTE: DOXYGEN GENERATED DOCUMENTATION WILL BE ADDED SOON !!!
Documentation is generated from the source code at compile time if 
doxygen is installed on the machine. From the build directory, open
doc/html/index.html with a web browser.

A wiki with detailed information is set up at
http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/wiki/HLT

8. Reporting bugs/Asking for support
====================================
Please include the following information into your request:
- config.log from your build directory
- output of the make process. Note: Redirect BOTH the stdout and stderr
  channel to a log file. Redirection depends on the shell you are using:
    bash: make 2>&1 | tee make.log 
    csh: make |& tee make.log
  The 'tee' command just duplicates the output.
- history of the commands you are using for compilation
  history > history.log

9. Committing to the AliRoot CVS
================================
At some point you might want to add the library to the AliRoot HLT module.
Please contact Matthias.Richter@ift.uib.no and send a stable version as a
tar archive.
