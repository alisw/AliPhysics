/*! \page READMEemcfw The EMCAL and Jet analysis framework 

The EMCAL framework consists of several parts:

- \subpage READMEcorefw
- \subpage READMEtrgfw
- \subpage READMEjetfw

Goal of the EMCAL framework is to provide the user with all functionalities
to steer the different steps in the preparation chain, handle data, process
trigger quantities, and combine common functionalities. Furthermore helper
classes for various issues are provided.

It takes care of the EMCAL cluster correction, of the EMCal triggers, and of the jet reconstruction.

## Structure of the directories

Perhaps not optimal separation, for historical reasons

- PWG/EMCAL
- PWG/JETFW
- PWGJE/EMCalJetTasks
- PWGJE/FlavourTasks
- PWGJE/StrangnessTasks
- PWGJE/EMCalJetTasks/UserTasks
