/**
 * @class AliEmcalTriggerDecision
 * @brief Container for trigger decision
 * @ingroup EMCALTRGFW
 * @author Markus Fasel <markus.fasel@cern.ch>
 * @since Dec 17, 2014
 * 
 * # Status of the trigger selection process for a given Level1 trigger
 * 
 * AliEmcalTriggerDecision object collect all relevant information for 
 * a given Level1 trigger:
 * 
 * - Maximum patch firing the trigger
 * - All other patches firing the trigger
 * - A corresponding trigger selection cuts object defining the selection process
 * 
 * An AliEmcalTriggerDecision object handles only one Level1 trigger class,
 * each trigger class supported by the dataset has its own AliEmcalTriggerDecision
 * object.
 * 
 * ## Checking whether an event was triggered for the given Level1 trigger
 * 
 * The presence of a maximum patch marks an event as triggered. Consequently it
 * is sufficient to check for the presence of this. The following example selects
 * events triggered by the EG1 trigger:
 * 
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * auto trgcont = static_cast<PWG::EMCAL::AliEmcalTriggerDecisionContainer*>(fInputEvent->FindListObject("EmcalTriggerDecision"));
 * auto eg1 = trgcont->FindTriggerDecision("EG1");
 * if(eg1->GetMainPatch()) {
 *   std::cout << "Event is an EG1 event";
 * }
 * ~~~
 * 
 * ## Getting informatinon about all patches firing the trigger
 *
 * The trigger is fired if at least one patch above threshold according to the definition in the associated
 * trigger selection cuts is found. Consequently all patches above  threshold are valid trigger patches. 
 * They are attached to the event and can be queried via  GetAcceptedPatches(). The following example draws 
 * the energy spectrum of all accepted trigger patches:
 * 
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * auto hPatchEnergy = new TH1F("hPatchEnergy", "PatchEnergy", 200, 0., 200.);
 * auto trgcont = static_cast<PWG::EMCAL::AliEmcalTriggerDecisionContainer*>(fInputEvent->FindListObject("EmcalTriggerDecision"));
 * auto eg1 = trgcont->FindTriggerDecision("EG1");
 * for(auto p : eg1) {
 *   auto patch = static_cast<AliEMCALTriggerPatchInfo *>(p);
 *   hPatchEnergy->Fill(patch->GetPatchE());  
 * } 
 * ~~~
 * 
 * The AliEmcalTriggerDecision object is not owner of the patches. Delete calls would probably lead to
 * double delets. Users must not delete patches attached.
 * 
 * ## Specification of the level1 trigger
 * 
 * The level1 trigger is specified in the corresponding AliEmcalTriggerSelectionCuts object. The specifications
 * consist of 
 * 
 * - Patch type (Gamma or Jet patch)
 * - Energy definition (FastOR ADC amplitude or FEE energy, smeared or non-smeared)
 * - Trigger threshold
 * 
 * The associated trigger selection cut object is used in the trigger selection process and linked to 
 * this trigger selection object. It can be queried via GetSelectionCuts(). The following example indicates 
 * how to query the trigger threshold:
 * 
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * auto trgcont = static_cast<PWG::EMCAL::AliEmcalTriggerDecisionContainer*>(fInputEvent->FindListObject("EmcalTriggerDecision"));
 * auto eg1 = trgcont->FindTriggerDecision("EG1"); 
 * auto cuts = eg1->GetSelectionCuts();
 * std::cout << "Threshold for EG1: " << cuts->GetThreshold() << std::endl;
 * ~~~
 * 
 * The trigger decision object is not owner of the trigger selection cuts. Users must not delete them.
