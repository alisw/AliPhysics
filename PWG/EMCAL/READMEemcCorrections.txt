# EMCal Correction Framework

The new EMCal correction framework centralizes all of the analysis-level EMCal corrections into a single task:
AliEmcalCorrectionTask. This task coordinates the running of a configurable list of individual "correction components", where a
correction component means a single correction to be performed: cell-level energy calibration, or cluster-level non-linearity
correction, or cluster-track matching, etc. The set of corrections to run, as well as their order and their configurable
parameters, is set in a YAML configuration file. A default config file containing the centralized standard set of parameters is
shared by all users, and each user additionally writes their own user config file, overwriting desired variables.

The motivation of this new approach is the following:
- Centralize code so that there are not many similar versions of code used by different people
- Provide a simple and unified interface to make life easier for both users and developers
- Reduce likelihood of mistakes for users (make it obvious to a user if they are deviating from a recommended config, and avoid setting arguments through ``AddTask`` macros)

The following correction components are available:
- [CellBadChannel](\ref AliEmcalCorrectionCellBadChannel) -- Sets cells marked as bad to E = 0, using OADB bad channel map.
- [CellEnergy](\ref AliEmcalCorrectionCellEnergy) -- Performs energy calibration of cells, using OADB calibration.
- [CellTimeCalib](\ref AliEmcalCorrectionCellTimeCalib) -- Performs time calibration of cells, using OADB calibration.
- [Clusterizer](\ref AliEmcalCorrectionClusterizer) -- Clusterizes a collection of cells into a collection of clusters.
- [ClusterExotics](\ref AliEmcalCorrectionClusterExotics) -- Flags exotic clusters for removal from the cluster collection.
- [ClusterNonLinearity](\ref AliEmcalCorrectionClusterNonLinearity) -- Corrects cluster energy for non-linear response.
- [ClusterTrackMatcher](\ref AliEmcalCorrectionClusterTrackMatcher) -- Matches each track to a single cluster, if they are in close enough proximity.
- [ClusterHadronicCorrection](\ref AliEmcalCorrectionClusterHadronicCorrection) -- For clusters that have one or more matched tracks, reduces the cluster energy in order to avoid overestimating the particle's energy.

This new correction task unifies what was previously done by tasks such as:
 - [EMCal Tender](\ref AliEmcalTenderTask)
 - [ClusterizerFast](\ref AliAnalysisTaskEMCALClusterizeFast)
 - [ClusterMaker](\ref AliEmcalClusterMaker)
 - [ClusTrackMatcher](\ref AliEmcalClusTrackMatcherTask)
 - [HadCorr](\ref AliHadCorrTask)

...and other similar tasks.

# Prerequisites

To use the EMCal Correction Framework, it is highly recommended (but _NOT_ required) to use EMCal containers in your user task. Note that it is not required to use AliAnalysisTaskEmcal to use EMCal containers! For more on how to interface with this, please see the section on setting input objects to the Correction Task. 

# Using the EMCal Corrections Framework

Below, follow the instructions to implement the new Correction Task in your analysis. Further down the page, you will find
instructions on how to transition from the old correction method(s) to the new correction method, including how to configure the
corrections, and how to test your analysis results in the new vs. old correction method.

# %Setup the Correction Task 

There are two steps:
- [Configure the Correction Add Task](\ref configureEMCalCorrectionRunMacro)
- [Configure the Corrections](\ref configureEMCalCorrections)

# Switching to the EMCal Corrections Framework

For those who are switching to this framework, a special page has been prepared to explain the process.
This page explains how to configure the correction framework alongside the previous set of corrections, allowing
you to test and show that you get the same results with the new and old corrections!
For the instructions, please see \subpage READMEemcCorrectionsChange.

# Configure the Correction Add Task (or train wagon)            {#configureEMCalCorrectionRunMacro}

To enable the correction task, add the following lines to your run macro:

~~~{.cxx}
AliEmcalCorrectionTask * correctionTask = AddTaskEmcalCorrectionTask();
correctionTask->SelectCollisionCandidates(kPhysSel);
// Set the run period, same as the track container
// If you derived from the file "runEMCalJetSampleTask.C", then it is likely stored under "sRunPeriod.Data()"
correctionTask->SetRunPeriod("LHC11h");
// Set the user configuration file, assuming that your file is called "userConfiguration.yaml" and is located in
// the current directory. This also supports alien:// paths!
correctionTask->SetUserConfigurationFilename("userConfiguration.yaml");
// Initialize the configuration and corrections in the correction task
// It is EXTREMELY important to run this function in your run macro!
correctionTask->Initialize();
~~~

Don't forget to also load the macro with:

~~~{.cxx}
gROOT->LoadMacro("$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/EMCAL/macros/AddTaskEmcalCorrectionTask.C");
~~~

# Configuring Corrections                                      {#configureEMCalCorrections}

The corrections configuration file is specified via a file written in the YAML markup language. YAML is quite
readable and is commonly used for configuration files. Although it should be straightforward to read and write,
more information on its use can be found through the examples available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
**All** configuration and options are set through the YAML file, from setting the clusterizer type to the name of
the tracks!

The configuration is determined by two files: the base default file (located in ``$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/EMCAL/config/``),
as well as the user configuration file. Any changes that you need to make should be done in the user configuration file!
Note that any setting that you have in the user file will override the default file!

## Introducing features of the configuration file

We will discuss a number of features including:
- Setting cells, clusters, and tracks (input objects)
- Comments
- Enumerations
- Advanced usage options

To discuss the configuration and introduce, consider the configuration excerpt below as an example:

~~~
# This is a comment! Comments can also be on inline - everything after the hash is a comment
inputObjects:                               # Define all of the input objects for the corretions
    cells:                                  # Configure cells
        # The user can select the name of each container
        # The names don't need to correspond to any particular scheme
        defaultCells:
            # Note that we support the "usedefault" pattern of setting branch names.
            branchName: "usedefault"
    clusterContainers:                      # Configure clusters
        # The user can select the name of each container
        # The names don't need to correspond to any particular scheme
        defaultClusterContainer:            # Name of a cluster input (corresponds to a cluster container)
            # Sets the branch name
            branchName: "usedefault"
            # Takes all default cuts!

            trackFilterType: kHybridTracks          # Set the track filter type. Check the documentation for possible values
            #aodFilterBits:                         # Can also set AOD filter bits. Check the docuemntation for more information

~~~

### Setting cells, clusters, and tracks (input objects)

To properly configured the Correction Tasks, we need to indicate which cells, clusters, and tracks are needed (collectively referred to as input objects). These are configured in the ``inputObjects`` section. Within this section, we configure ``cells`` for input cells, ``clusterContainers`` for input cluster containers, and ``trackContainers`` for input tracks. Note that each subsection can contain multiple objects.

Each input object follows the same pattern:

~~~
objectName:                         # Used to refer to this object in the YMAL configuration
    branchName: "usedefault"        # The name of the branch that we want. The "usedefualt" pattern is supported here
    option: value                   # We support a wide variety of options, listed below.
~~~

Although it is not required for your task to use EMCal containers, they are used internally in the Correction Task, so it is important to understand a bit about how they work. In particular, any filtering of the collections (such as AOD Track Filtering) is applied for the corrections, but the filtering does not remove anything from the collections!
In addition, we always write cell/cluster/track corrections in place - it is generally not possible to write out new collections. Thus, it is then the users' responsibility to filter the collection using the information available! One particularly easy way to do so is to use EMCal containers, but it is not required! In the case that the user wants to manually filter, for example, tracks before running the Correction Framework, one can run AOD Track Filtering and then select no additional track filtering using ``kNoTrackFilter``.

The available configuration options are listed below. Direct configuration through the YAML file is limited to a subset of all available configuration options. If you require additional options, please contact the developers - such additions are usually trivial. Alternatively, after calling ``Initialize()``, all containers are available for configuration as usual, so any additional options can be set by hand until implemented by the developers.

__Cells__:
| Property              | Value                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| branchName            | String selecting the branch name  |

__EMCal Containers__:
| Property              | Value                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Container name        | This is set by the object name in the YAML config |
| branchName            | String selecting the branch name  |
| minPt                 | Double setting the minimum pT of the container |
| minE                  | Double setting the minimum energy of the container |
| (minEta, maxEta)      | A pair of doubles to set the min and max eta of the container. Note that they must be set as a pair! |
| (minPhi, maxPhi)      | A pair of doubles to set the min and max phi of the container. Note that they must be set as a pair! |

__Clusters__ (Includes all options for EMCal Containers):
| Property              | Value                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| clusNonLinCorrEnergyCut | Double determining the cluster non-linearity energy cut |
| clusHadCorrEnergyCut  | Double determining the cluster hadronic cluster energy cut |
| includePHOS           | True if PHOS cluster should be included |

__Tracks__ (Includes all options for EMCal Containers):
| Property              | Value                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| trackFilterType       | Enumerated value determining the track filtering to apply to the container.  The enumerations are defined in AliEmcalTrackSelection and include: kNoTrackFilter, kCustomTrackFilter, kHybridTracks, kTPCOnlyTracks |
| aodFilterBits         | Sets values based on the evaluated bits (ie to set bit 3, pass 2^3 = 8). To set it properly, see below. To use aodFilterBits, Be sure to set the trackFilterType to kCustomTrackFilter! |
| trackCutsPeriod       | Sets the track cuts period for the track container. A default can also be set for all track containers using static methods of AliTrackContainer independent of the correction task. See AliTrackContainer for more information |

The aodFilterBits are set as an array. This is possible to express in two ways in YAML:

~~~
aodFilterBits: [1, 256]
# Alternatively
aodFilterBits:
 - 1
 - 256
~~~

### Comments

Comments include anything after a hash ("#"). Of course, they are not required, but are highly recommended! You can
add a comment on the same line as where you define a property - just add the "#" after you are done defining the property.

### Enumerations

Enumerations are supported as expected. Just set the value as you normally would. However, be sure that you don't
include class where it is defined!

### Example configuration and further information

For a survey of the available configuration options and information about the meaning of each, see the default
configuration file located in ``$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/EMCAL/config/``. This also serves as an example configuration,
Note that once the Correction Task is initialized using the ``Initialize()`` function, all corrections are
configured and created. Consequently, any additional configuration can be done manually if desired. However,
this approach is strongly discouraged. Instead, it is better to change the YAML configuration file so that
there is a record of settings.

#### Advanced usage options

There are a number of useful advanced options to make the Corrections Framework simpler and more pleasant to use. These options are described below.

#### Shared parameters

Often, a user will want to change some parameters in unison. Say, if a pt cut is changed, it should be changed everywhere. In such a case, it is useful to able to define a variable so that one change will change things everything. This can be accomplished by defining a parameters in the "shared parameters" section of the YAML file. The name of the parameter defined in the shared parameters section can be referenced in other areas of the file by prepending ``sharedParameters:`` to the parameter name. Consider the example below:

~~~
sharedParameters:
    aMinimumValue: 3
Correction1:
    exampleValue: "sharedParameters:aMinimumValue"
    ...
Correction2:
    anotherExample: "sharedParameters:aMinimumValue"
~~~

In the example, any change to ``aMinimumValue`` will be propagated to ``exampleValue`` in ``Correction1`` and ``anotherExample`` in ``Correction2``. Note that the parameter name (here, ``aMinimumValu``) can be anything that the user desires. When setting the value, don't forget to prepend "sharedParameters:" (in our example, "sharedParameters:aMinimumValu")!

#### Running multiple corrections at once ("specializing")

Often, a user would like to run two nearly identical corrections. For instance, one could run two clusterizers with the same configuration, but perhaps different input cells and output clusters. In such a case, the clusterizer can be "specialized", such that each of the two clusterizers will inherit the same settings except for the cells. Consider the following example YAML configuration file:

~~~
inputObjects:
    cells:
        defaultCells:
            branchName: "usedefault"
        anotherCells:
            branchName: "otherCellsBranch"
    clusterContainers:
        defaultClusterContainer:
            branchName: "usedefault"
            minPt: 3
        anotherClusterContainer:
            branchName: "someOtherClustersBranch"
# Cell corrections ...
Clusterizer:
    enabled: true
    clusterizer: kClusterizerv2
    cellE: 0.05
    seedE: 0.1
    ...
    cellsNames:
        - defaultCells
    clusterContainersNames:
        - defaultClusterContainer
Clusterizer_mySpecialization:
    cellsNames:
        - anotherCells
    clusterContainersNames:
        - anotherClusterContainer
~~~

In this example, two clusterizers are configured: ``Clusterizer`` and ``Clusterizer_mySpecializedClusterizer``. Both have the exact same configuration, with the exception that ``Clusterizer`` uses ``defaultCells`` for cells and ``defaultClusterContainer`` for clusters, while ``Clusterizer_mySpecializedClusterizer`` uses ``anotherCells`` for cells and ``anotherClusterContainer`` for clusters (note: the cells branch would have to be created elsewhere, say with ``AliEmcalCopyCollection``). 

To execute these corrections, we must select them in the AddTask of the Correction Task. To do so, set the suffix argument of the AddTask to correspond with the specialization suffix that was set in the YAML file. Continuing with the previous example, we would need to add:

~~~{.cxx}
// The default argument is an empty string, so we don't have to set it here.
AliEmcalCorrectionTask * correctionTask = AddTaskEmcalCorrectionTask(); 
// Create the specialized correction task
AliEmcalCorrectionTask * correctionTaskSpecialized = AddTaskEmcalCorrectionTask("mySpecialization");
~~~

Note that in doing this, it is then required that all additional corrections after the first specialized component are also specialized. This is necessary to make the users intentions clear. Continuing with the two clusterizers example, if we then want to run the cluster-track matcher, then we must created both ``ClusterTrackMatcher`` and ``ClusterTrackMatcher_mySpecialization`` with the proper configuration.

It is extremely important to be careful to avoid apply corrections multiple times to the same collections! For instance, if running two clusterizers on the same cells collection, then the cell corrections must be disabled for one of the two corrections! If the above example had used the same cells, then it would have been required to disable them in one correction task (say, the "mySpecialization" task).

# Details on the framework and the corrections

You can see the code at ``$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/EMCAL/EMCALtasks``. The steering class is ``AliEmcalCorrectionTask``. The
individual corrections inherit from ``AliEmcalCorrectionComponent``, and are labeled ``AliEmcalCorrectionXXXX``. Note
that neither ``AliEmcalCorrectionTask`` nor ``AliEmcalCorrectionComponent`` inherit from ``AliAnalysisTaskEmcal``.
However, they provide similar functionality. The default configuration file is at ``$ALICE_PHYSICS/PWG/EMCAL/config/AliEmcalConfiguration.yaml``.

NOTE: If you are interested in how a particular correction works, you only need to look at the particular correction and its configuration!
There are many other details in the base and steering classes, but they are almost certainly not relevant!

# Developing a correction

If you are interested in developing a task that is shared by analyses using the EMCal, then the correction
framework is a great place to deploy it! The general approach is very similar to the steering in
``AliAnalysisTaskEmcal``. To create your task, your task name should start with ``AliEmcalCorrection``. It should derive from ``AliEmcalCorrectionComponent`` and implement:

~~~{.cxx}
// Run once to initialize the component. These are run independent initializations.
virtual Bool_t Initialize();
// Execute in the first event for run dependent initialization. Same as in AliAnalysisTaskEmcal
virtual void ExecOnce();
// Executed before the first event. Same as in AliAnalysisTaskSE
virtual void UserCreateOutputObjects();
// Called each event. Same as in AliAnalysisTaskEmcal
virtual Bool_t Run();
// UserNotify() from AliAnalysisTaskSE
virtual Bool_t UserNotify();
~~~

To configure your task in the ``Initialize()`` function with the YAML configuration, you must define the object and then get it via the ``GetProperty("propertyName", property)`` function defined in ``AliEmcalCorrectionComponent``. For an example, see any ``Initialize()`` in any of the correction components.

Lastly, the task needs to be added to the default YAML configuration file. To do so, add the name of the component (removing "AliEmcalCorrection") to the file, and then set default values for each parameter. Be certain to document what each parameter means! In addition to the component configuration, be certain to add it into the executionOrder node! Otherwise, your task will never be executed!
