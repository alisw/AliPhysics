 * @class TCustomBinning
 * @brief Helper class creating user defined custom binning.

 *
 * A custom binning is defined by a user an can contain bins of different width. The
 * user has to define ranges in which the bin width is equal, bin edges are calculated
 * accordingly. Do do so, the first step is to define a minimum for the range.
 *
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * TCustomBinning mybinning;
 * mybinning.SetMinimum(-100.);
 * ~~~
 *
 * Now ranges can be added via the AddStep function:
 *
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * mybinning.AddStep(-10., 10.);
 * mybinning.AddStep(10., 1.);
 * mybinning.AddStep(100., 10);
 * ~~~
 *
 * In this example the binning is done:
 * - from -100 to -10 in steps of 10
 * - from -10 to 10 in steps of 1
 * - from 10 to 100 in steps of 10
 *
 * The binning can be converted to a TArrayD which contains the bin edges in increasing order:
 *
 * ~~~{.cxx}
 * TArrayD binlimits;
 * mybinning.CreateBinEdges(binlimits);
 * ~~~
 *
 * @note In case the binning is used together with the THistManager the last step is done by the
 * THistManager and does not need to be performed by the user.
