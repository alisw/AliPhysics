    \hline 
    \textbf{Symbol}&\textbf{Description}\\
    \hline 
    \INEL & In--elastic event\\ 
    \INELONE & In--elastic event with at least one tracklet in the
               \SPD{} in the region $-1\le\eta\le1$\\ 
    \NSD{} & Non--single--diffractive event.  Single diffractive
             events are events where one of the incident collision
             systems (proton or nucleus) is excited and radiates
             particles, but there is no other processes taking place\\  
    \hline
    $\NT{}$ & Number of events with a valid trigger\\
    $\NV{}$ & Number of events with a valid trigger \emph{and} a valid
              vertex.\\  
    $\NA{}$ & Number of events with a valid trigger
              \emph{and} a valid vertex \emph{within} the selected
              vertex range.\\  
    $\N{a,c,ac,e}{}$ & Number of events with background triggers $A$,
                       $B$, $AC$, or $E$, \emph{and} a valid off-line
                       trigger of the considered type.   Background
                       triggers are typically flagged with the trigger
                       words \texttt{CINT1-A},  \texttt{CINT1-C}, 
                       \texttt{CINT1-AC}, \texttt{CINT1-E}, or
                       similar.\\ 
    \hline
    $\mult{}$ & Charged particle multiplicity\\ 
    $\mult[,\text{primary}]$ & Primary charged particle multiplicity
                               as given by simulations\\ 
    $\mult[,\text{\FMD{}}]$ & Number of charged particles that hit the
                              \FMD{} as given by simulations\\ 
    $n_t$ & Number of charged particles in an \FMD{} strip as
            given by evaluating the energy response functions $G$\\ 
    \hline
    $F$ & Energy response function (see \secref{sec:fits})\\

    $\SecMap{}$ & Secondary particle correction factor in $\etaphi$
                  for a given interaction point $\IPz$\\  
    $\DeadCh{}$ & Acceptance in $\etaphi$ for a given interaction
                  point $\IPz$\\  
    \hline
    $\dndetadphi[incl,r,\subIPz,i]$ & Inclusive (primary \emph{and}
                                      secondary) charge particle
                                      density in event $i$ with
                                      interaction point $\IPz$,

    $\dndetadphi[\subIPz,i]$ & Primary charged particle density in
                               event $i$ with interaction point
                               $\IPz$\\   
    $\phiAcc$ & $\varphi$ acceptance in $\eta$ bin for event $i$\\
    $\etaCov$ & $\eta$ coverage of event $i$\\ 
    $\PhiAcc$ & Integrated $\eta$ acceptance over $\NA$ events.
                Note, that this has a value of $\NA$ for $(\eta)$ bins
                where we have full coverage\\ 
    \hline 
    $X_t$ & Value $X$ for strip number $t$ (0-511 for inner rings,
            0-255 for outer rings)\\
