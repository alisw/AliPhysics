\section{Building the final $\ndndeta$}
\label{sec:ana_aod}

To build the final $\ndndeta$ for a given event selection $X$ we loop
over the events stored in the \AOD{} and extract the per--event,
vertex dependent, exclusive or inclusive number of charged particles
per $\etaphi$ bin.   

\subsection{Event selection}

Generally, the event selection consists of 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Selecting events with a primary interaction that has a $z$
  coordinate $\IPz$ within some specified range --- typically
  $|\IPz|\le\unit[10]{cm}$. 
\item Rejecting events that have been flagged as containing pile--up.
  Typically, the \SPD{} tracklet pile--up flag is used. 
\item Rejecting events that have been flagged as an \SPD{} outlier
  event. 
\item Selecting events that have a given trigger type.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A trigger type $X$ can be simple triggers like \texttt{MBOR},
    \texttt{MBOR} and at least one tracklet in the \SPD{} within
    $|\eta|<1$ (a.k.a.~\INELGT{}), or \texttt{V0AND}. 
  \item Alternatively, the trigger $X$ can depend on some event
    characteristic e.g., centrality or reference multiplicity. In that
    case, we select on the quantity and perform the analysis in bins
    of that quantity.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

All standard centrality estimators are supported.  Furthermore, the
reference multiplicity\footnote{The number of unique tracks and
  tracklets within $|\eta|<0.8$.} is supported, as well as the special
\ppCol{} centrality estimators developed for the RunII
High--Multiplicity Task--Force.

\paragraph{\ppCol{} event classes and trigger efficiencies} 

When determining $\ndndeta$ for physical event classes in \ppCol{},
such as the full in--elastic cross--section, or the
non--single--diffractive events, we choose the underlying hardware and
replayed software trigger that gives the highest efficiency for that
event class.  \tabref{tab:dndeta:ppclasses} summarises the interesting
physical event classes in \ppCol{}, together with the underlying
trigger and its corresponding efficiency for each of the studied
collision energies.  Note, that the event class \INELGT{} is a pure
experimental event class, and as such the trigger efficiency is by
definition unity.

\end{table}


\subsection{Summing $\dndeta$ and normalisation} 

To build the final $\ndndeta$ distribution it is enough to sum
\eqref{eq:superhist} (or \eqref{eq:superhist:2} if the secondary map
correction was turned off) and \eqref{eq:overflow} over all accepted
events, $\NA$, and correct for the acceptance
$\PhiAcc{}\,$\footnote{Since $\phiAcc$ is 1 or slightly less, we have
  that $\PhiAcc$ is roughly equal to (but not bigger than) $\NA$.}
\begin{align}
  \dndetadphi &= \sum_i^{\NA}\dndetadphi[i,\subIPz]\\ 
  \PhiAcc &= \sum_i^{\NA}\phiAcc\\
\intertext{and integrating over $\varphi$ gives}
  \ndndeta &=
  \frac{\NA}{\N{X}{}} \frac1{\Delta\eta} \int_0^{2\pi} \text{d}\varphi
  \frac{\dndetadphi}{\PhiAcc}\quad,\label{eq:eventnormdndeta}
\end{align}
where $\NA/\N{X}{}$ is the trigger normalisation for events of type
$X$.  The trigger normalisation $\N{X}{}$ is given by
\cite{normalization} 
\begin{align}
  \N{X}{} &= \frac{1}{\epsilon_X}\left[\NA +
    \alpha(\NnotV{} -
    \beta)\right]  \label{eq:fulleventnorm}\\
  & = \frac{1}{\epsilon_X}\left[\NA + \frac{\NA}{\NV}(\NT-\NV{} -
    \beta)\right]\nonumber \\
  & =\frac{1}{\epsilon_X}\NA\left[1+\frac{1}{\epsilon_V}-1-
    \frac{\beta}{\NV}\right]\nonumber\\
  & = \frac{1}{\epsilon_X}\frac{1}{\epsilon_V}\NA
  \left(1-\frac{\beta}{\NT{}}\right)\nonumber
\end{align}
where
\begin{description}
\item[$\epsilon_X$]  is the trigger efficiency for type
  $X\in\{\INEL,\INELONE,\NSD\}$ for \ppCol{} data and $\text{CENT}$
  for \PbPbCol{} and \pPbCol{}/\PbpCol{} data
\item[$\epsilon_V=\frac{\NV{}}{\NT{}}$] is the primary vertex
  efficiency evaluated over the data sample.
\item[$\NA$] is the number of events with a trigger \emph{and} a valid
  vertex in the selected range
\item[$\NV{}$] is the number of events with a trigger \emph{and} a valid
  vertex. 
\item[$\NT$] is the number of events with a trigger.
\item[$\NnotV{}=\NT-\NV{}$] is the number of events with a trigger
  \emph{but no} valid vertex
\item[$\alpha=\frac{\NA}{\NV}$] is the fraction of accepted events
  relative to the total number of events that have a trigger and valid vertex.  
\item[$\beta=\N{a}{}+\N{c}{}-\N{e}{}$] is the number of background
  events \emph{with} a valid off-line trigger. This formula is the
  simplest case of one bunch crossing per trigger/background
  class. For more complicated collision setups the fractions in the
  formula change.
\end{description}
The two terms under the parentheses in \eqref{eq:fulleventnorm} refer
to the observed number of event $\NA$, and the events missed because
of missing vertex reconstruction.  Note, for $\beta\ll\NT{}$
%% \eqref{eq:fulleventnorm} 
this reduces to the simpler expression
$$
\N{X}{} = \frac1{\epsilon_X}\frac1{\epsilon_V}\NA{}
$$
The trigger efficiency $\epsilon_X$ for a given trigger type $X$ is
evaluated from simulations as
\begin{align*}
  \epsilon_X = \frac{\N{X\wedge \text{T}}{}}{\N{X}{}}\quad,
\end{align*}
that is, the ratio of number of events of type $X$ with a
corresponding trigger $T$ relative to the number of events of type
$X$.

If the trigger $X$ introduces a bias on the measured number of events,
then \eqref{eq:eventnormdndeta} needs to be modified to 
\begin{align}
  \ndndeta &= 
  \frac{\NA}{\N{X}{}}\frac1{\Delta\eta} \int_0^{2\pi} \text{d}\varphi
  \frac{1}{B\etaphi}\frac{\dndetadphi}{\PhiAcc}
  \label{eq:eventnormdndeta2}\quad,
\end{align}
where $B\etaphi$ is the bias correction.  This is typically
calculated from simulations using the expression 
\begin{align*}
  B\etaphi = \frac{\frac{1}{\N{X\wedge \text{T}}{}}\sum_i^{\N{X\wedge
        \text{T}}{}}
    \mult[,\text{primary}]\etaphi}{\frac{1}{\N{X}{}}\sum_i^{\N{X}{}}
    \mult[,\text{primary}]\etaphi}
\end{align*}
Note that typically $B\etaphi$ is unity independent of collision
system, energy, or particle multiplicity. 

%% --- Sub section on the empirical correction -----------------------
\subsection{The Empirical Correction} 
\label{sec:sub:empirical} 

The precision of the simulation based correction for secondary
particle production $\SecMap{}$ depends strongly on the accuracy with
which the material is specified in the simulation.  If there is not
enough or too much material (compared to the actual experiment)
specified in the simulations, we will calculate a too low or too high
value for $\SecMap$.  Also, even if the correct amount of material
\emph{is} present, but placed incorrectly, we will have a wrong
distribution of $\SecMap$.  Since there are many parts in the various
detectors, some of which are hard to describe and hence incompletely
specified, it is very unlikely that we will ever reach a high enough
accuracy so that $\SecMap$ is not associated with very large
uncertainties.

\begin{figure}[th!bp]
  \centering
  \figinput{satellite}
  \caption{Schematic drawing (not to scale) of the cross-section of
    the \ITS{}, \FMD{}, and \VZERO{} and the midpoints of the
    locations of the nominal and `satellite' interaction points. The
    long--dashed line designates a region of dense material designed
    to absorb all particles except $\mu^{\pm}$. The short-dashed line
    indicates the region of the \ALICE{} \ITS{}, which has dense
    material for its services on the surfaces near \FMD{2} and
    \FMD{3}. The area between \FMD{2}, \FMD{1} and \VZERO{}-A contains
    only the beryllium beam pipe. The dark grey shaded areas denote
    the paths particles would follow from $z=\unit[0]{\text{cm}}$ and
    $z=\unit[225]{\text{cm}}$ to \FMD{2} and \VZERO{}-A such that it
    is evident which material they would traverse
    \cite{Abbas:2013bpa}.}
  \label{fig:satellite_geom}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Satellite Collisions} 
However, in the \PbPbCol{} running of 2010\footnote{The
  \texttt{LHC10h} period.} we were fortunate that the machine provided
collisions of beams at so--called \emph{satellite} locations.

These collisions occurred at
$$
z \approx -187.5, -150, \ldots, -37.5, 37.5, 75, \ldots, 300,
\unit[337.5]{\text{cm}} \quad, 
$$ 
and were a consequence of the so-called `debunching effect'
\cite{maxime}.  Particles produced in these off--nominal interaction
point collisions propagate through very different regions of the
\ALICE{} detector material, as illustrated in
\figref{fig:satellite_geom}.

Particles produced in collisions at say
$z\approx\unit[225]{\text{cm}}$ pass through a lot less material than
particles produced at the nominal interaction region
($z\approx\unit[0]{\text{cm}}$), and the material they do pass through
(mostly the beam--pipe) is a lot simpler and much better described in
the simulations.  This was exploited to produce the \ndndeta{}
distributions for \PbPbCol{} at \usNN{PbPb}{2760} for centrality bins
$0-5-10-20-30\%$ \cite{Abbas:2013bpa}.  Another benefit of this
approach was the overlap between the \FMD{} and \VZERO{} acceptance,
and that the \VZERO{} and \FMD{} results could be checked against the
results from the \SPD{} tracklets.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]

    $\EmpCor[c]{}$ for 4 centralities, and the average of these.  The

    this we see we $\pm2\%$ systematic uncertainty on
    $\EmpCor{}$. \subref{fig:empirical:secmap} The average empirical
    correction compared to simulation based

    correction obtained from the satellite \PbPbCol{} collisions.  The
    filled coloured regions show the
    $\langle\SecMap\rangle=1/2\pi\int\text{d}\varphi\SecMap{}$
    obtained from simulations.} 
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Nominal interactions} 
We can then turn the argument around to form a new correction for
secondaries.  We perform the inclusive (primaries \emph{and}
secondaries) analysis for the pseudo--rapidity density
(\ndndeta{}$|_{\text{nominal,inclusive}}$) for \PbPbCol{} at
\usNN{PbPb}{2760} at nominal interaction points
($z\in[\unit[-10]{\text{cm}},\unit[+10]{\text{cm}}]$) by turning off
the secondary correction $\SecMap$ (see
\secref{sec:sub:sub:secmap}). 

The \emph{empirical correction} is then defined as

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:empirical:cent}
  \EmpCor[c]{} = \frac{%
    \left.\ndndeta\right|_{\text{nominal,inclusive}}}{%
    \left.\ndndeta\right|_{\text{satellite}}}\quad,
\end{equation}
where the denominator is the result from the satellite \PbPbCol{} at
\usNN{PbPb}{2760} analysis \cite{Abbas:2013bpa}, and the numerator is
the result from collisions at the nominal interaction point
\emph{without} the secondary correction.  The sub-script $c$ indicates
that we can form this ratio separately in each of the 4 centrality
bins we have satellite results for.  The result is shown in
\figref{fig:empirical:cent}.

\paragraph{Stability}
We see that the correction is stable over all centralities and that we
can use the weighted average over all centralities to define 

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:empirical}
  \EmpCor{} = \frac{\sum_c \Delta c\EmpCor[c]{}}{\sum_c \Delta c}\quad.
\end{equation}

Further motivation for the empirical correction as a correction for
the produced secondary corrections, is found in
\figref{fig:empirical:secmap}.  Here, the simulation based $\SecMap$
is compared to the data driven $\EmpCor$.  We see that overall
$\EmpCor$ follows the shape of $\SecMap$ with differences at $\eta<0$
and around $\eta=2$ -- as we would expect from a correction that
depends on the material distribution.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
  \centering
  \subfigure[]{
    \label{fig:empirical:compare_es}\figinput[.55\linewidth]{compare_es}}
  \subfigure[]{
    \label{fig:empirical:es_pp0900}\figinput[.35\linewidth]{es_pp0900}}
  \caption{\subref{fig:empirical:compare_es} Comparison of $\EmpCor$
    and $\EmpCor[\subIPz,r]{}$.  The spread of $\EmpCor[\subIPz,r]{}$
    reflects the different material seen at different values of
    $\IPz$.  \subref{fig:empirical:es_pp0900} Comparison between
    applying either $\EmpCor$ or $\EmpCor[\subIPz,r]{}$ to \ppCol{} at
    \usNN{pp}{0900}. }
  \label{fig:empirical:methods}
\end{figure}

The correction $\EmpCor$ is applied after summing over events, rings,
and interaction points.  In principle we could form the ratio of
\eqref{eq:empirical:cent} in separate $\IPz$ bins and separately for
each \FMD{} ring.  We would then apply that correction
$\EmpCor[\subIPz,r]{}$ instead of $\SecMap$ as outlined in
\secref{sec:sub:sub:secmap}.  A comparison of the two methods is shown
in \figref{fig:empirical:methods}.  We see that the difference in
using either the single correction $\EmpCor$ or the interaction point,
ring dependent correction $\EmpCor[\subIPz,r]{}$, is less than 2\%.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
  \centering
  \figinput[.9\linewidth]{empcor_stable}
  \caption{Stability of $\EmpCor$. The top panel shows the empirical
    correction using different runs for the inclusive reference
    (numerator of \eqref{eq:empirical:cent}).  At the bottom, the
    ratio to the canonical reference run (138190) is shown, as well as
    the average distance to that canonical reference. Two groups are
    clearly seen: Before run 138190 (circles) and after run 138190
    (squares).  From the Quality Assurance we know that the runs
    before 138190 are problematic, and are therefore not considered. }
  \label{fig:empirical:empcor_stable}
\end{figure}

The empirical correction shown in \figref{fig:empirical:methods} comes
from analysing a single run (138190) to obtain the numerator of
\eqref{eq:empirical:cent}.  To access the stability of the correction
with respect to the reference data, all of the \PbPbCol{} data from
2010 was analysed.  The result is shown in
\figref{fig:empirical:empcor_stable}.  Apart from a few problematic
runs before run 138190\footnote{QA of these earlier runs show a low
  energy loss contamination in all detectors --- typically attributed
  to an unknown beam--background.}, the resulting corrections all
agree within $\pm5\%$.


\paragraph{Universality} The empirical correction $\EmpCor$ as a
correction for secondary particle production is by nature
\emph{universal}.  That is, it can be applied to \emph{any} collision
system and energy since it depends only on the material in \ALICE{}.
Howver, as shown in \figref{fig:secmap:all} there is a residual
uncertainty from the hadron chemistry which especially effects
\FMD{1}.  This forces us to assign a systematic uncertainty of the
order of a few percent more in the \FMD{1} region than what we would
otherwise to in the remaining regions.  Note, that the uncertainty of
the empirical correction already contains a 2\% uncertainty from the
hadron--chemistry (see also \secref{sec:dndeta:sys:emp}).

The empirical correction is seen to be stable and known to within
$\pm5\%$.  


\paragraph{The final \ndndeta{}}
We can then apply this correction to the inclusive pseudo--rapidity
density (\indndeta{}) for \emph{any} system and collision energy to
find the \emph{primary} charged particle pseudo--rapidity density

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:empirical:applied}
  \ndndeta = \frac{1}{\EmpCor{}} \indndeta{}
\end{equation}

\begin{description}
\item[Event selection] \hbox{}\hfill
  \begin{description}
  \item[\INEL{} \& \NSD{}] The source of this systematic uncertainty
    is mainly the estimated uncertainty on the trigger selection, as
    well as the estimated uncertainty on the vertex reconstruction.
    Other sources include pile-up.  Of these sources, the most
    dominant is the trigger efficiency and the rest are considered
    negligible \cite{pwgud:2015}.
  \item[\INELGT{}] Since this trigger is purely experimentally defined
    there is not or very small uncertainty associated with the trigger
    efficiency, and the remaining contributions from vertex
    reconstruction and pile-up are negligible \cite{pwgud:2015}.
  \item[Centrality] The ranges given here are from most central (lower
    systematic error) to most peripheral (higher systematic uncertainty)
    \cite{Adam:2014qja,PbPbCent:XXX}.
  \end{description}
\item[Analysis] \hbox{}\hfill
  \begin{description}
  \item[Merging] This comes from the process of merging signals that
    are shared over 2 strips (see \secref{sec:sub:sharing_filter}).
    This has been evaluated by varying cuts and cut definitions (see
    \secref{sec:cuts} and \figref{fig:cuts:syserr}). The cuts were
    varied within the ranges that maintained the signal integrity.
  \item[Density] This comes from the estimation of the inclusive
    number of charge particles per $\etaphi$--bin.  The size of this
    uncertainty is estimated by evaluating the correlation between the
    two available methods for obtaining
    $\dndetadphi[incl,r,\subIPz,i]$ (see
    \secref{sec:sub:density_calculator}), and by varying the threshold
    cut and cut definitions (see \secref{sec:cuts} and
    \figref{fig:cuts:syserr}).  The cuts were varied within the ranges

  \begin{description}
  \item[Satellite] These are the systematic uncertainty from the
    published $\ndndeta$ based on an analysis of satellite collisions
    \cite{Abbas:2013bpa}.  The variation in the number stems from the
    uncertainty in the centrality determination, which presumably
    biases both the denominator and numerator of
    \eqref{eq:empirical:cent} in the same direction. The effect on the
    empirical correction is discussed in \secref{sec:dndeta:sys:emp}.
  \item[Reference] As shown in \figref{fig:empirical:cent} and
    \ref{fig:empirical:methods} the variation of chosen reference run
    and the choice of method results in a 5\% systematic
    uncertainty. The effect on the empirical correction is discussed
    in \secref{sec:dndeta:sys:emp}.
  \item[As--applied] This is the systematic uncertainty as applied to
    the data in the this analysis. The error is discussed in
    \secref{sec:dndeta:sys:emp}.
  \end{description}
\item[Hadron Chemistry] An additional 2\% in the \FMD{1} region should
  be added in quadrature and stems from the additional sensitivity to
  the hadron chemistry discussed elsewhere in
  \secref{sec:sub:sub:secmap}. Note that the systematic uncertainty on
  the empirical correction already contain a 2\% systematic
  uncertainty on this in the FMD region --- see
  \tabref{tab:satellite:syserrs}.

\subsubsection{Systematics Uncertainty from the Empirical Correction}
\label{sec:dndeta:sys:emp}

The \ndndeta{} in centrality bins from 0 to 30\% previously published
\cite{Abbas:2013bpa} is based on three measurements: \SPD{} tracklets,
\VZERO{} amplitude match to the \SPD{}, and the \FMD{} signals.  Each
of these measurements carried their own set of systematic
uncertainties, as well as some common
ones. \tabref{tab:satellite:syserrs} summarises the various
contributions.

The 3 measurements were added up using the non--common systematic
uncertainties as weights, and finally the common systematic
uncertainties were added in quadrature.  The result is shown in the
top of \figref{fig:dndeta:sat:results}. Subtracting the common
components from the centrality estimate from the systematic
uncertainty leaves us with an error of 7.2\% in the high limit, and
3.6\% in the low limit over the whole $\eta$ range.  In the limited
range of $-3.5\le\eta\le5$ for nominal $\IPz$ we found a low value of
$4.2$\% and a high value of $4.9$\%

  \caption{Top shows the \ndndeta{} from satellite collisions after
    summing the 3 measurements, and adding the common systematics in
    quadrature \cite{Abbas:2013bpa}.  The bottom panel shows the
    resulting relative systematic error for each centrality bin. For
    the points relevant for the forward analysis we see a variation
    from 3.75\% --- for the most central --- up to 7.5\% --- for the
    most peripheral.  The dashed line indicates the centrality
    weighted mean. }

As outlined in \secref{sec:sub:empirical}, the empirical correction is
formed by averaging over the available centralities 
\begin{equation}
  \EmpCor{} = \frac{\sum_c \Delta c\EmpCor[c]{}}{\sum_c \Delta c}
  \tag{\ref{eq:empirical}}
\end{equation}
where $\EmpCor[c]{}$ is given by \eqref{eq:empirical:cent}.  That
means, we should consider the centrality weighted systematic
uncertainty (as shown in \figref{fig:dndeta:sat:results}), and we find
a low value of $\sqrt{4.2^2-1.5^2}=3.9$\% and a high value of
$\sqrt{4.9^2-1.5^2}=4.7$\%, with an average of
$\sqrt{4.5^2-1.5^2}=4.2$ in the $\eta$ regions relevant for this
analysis.

The error on the numerator of \eqref{eq:empirical:cent} is given by
the run--to--run variation illustrated in
\figref{fig:empirical:empcor_stable}, and amounts to 4\%.  Adding this
up in quadrature gives the final systematic on the empirical
correction to be 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:empcorr:syserr}
  \min{\delta\EmpCor{}} &= \sqrt{3.9^2+4^2} = 5.6\%\nonumber\\
  \max{\delta\EmpCor{}} &= \sqrt{4.7^2+4^2} = 6.1\%\nonumber\\
  \langle\delta\EmpCor{}\rangle &= 5.8\%\quad.\\
\end{align}
Considering the overall variation across $\eta$ is relatively small,
we err on the side of caution and choose $\delta\EmpCor{}=6.1$\% for
the systematic uncertainty of empirical correction.
