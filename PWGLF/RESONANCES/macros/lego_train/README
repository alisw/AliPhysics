##### Init working direcotry to be able use lego_train stuff #####

# get source from RSN git (readonly version) [please install git]

mkdir -p $HOME/ALICE/
cd $HOME/ALICE/
git clone git://github.com/mvala/AliRsn.git

# to get latest source
cd $HOME/ALICE/AliRsn
git pull

# Let's create working direcotry (any directory you want)
mkdir -p /tmp/my_wk_dir
cd /tmp/my_wk_dir
$HOME/ALICE/AliRsn/scripts/alirsn-create-wk-dir.sh
# now you should have .C files needed to run analysis

# modify RsnManager.C to set your RSN you want to study
# for example line

listRsn->Add(new TNamed("Phi","Phi2010"));

# will use 
# AddRsnPairsPhi.C
# AddRsnDaughterCutsPhi2010.C
# more info in 'RsnManager.C'
# NOTE: ORDER of loading macros 
# 1. Looks for macro in local direcotry
# 2. Looks in direcotry defined in RsnManager.C as variable 'legoTrainPath'
#    Default is '$ALICE_ROOT/PWGLF/RESONANCES/macros/lego_train'

# if you want to use latest macros, which are not even in aliroot, but they are in RSN git, you can do
# in 'RsnManager.C' change legoTrainPath
# for example (my RSN git copy is located /home/mvala/ALICE/AliRsn)
legoTrainPath = "/home/mvala/ALICE/AliRsn/PWGLF/RESONANCES/macros/lego_train";

# and you can do for example , where 'my_local_data.txt' has
# list of files localy saved
